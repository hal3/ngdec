this paper summarizes the lpt data in the literature and presents a fundamental method for predicting lptspt correlations .
the proposed method is based on wave equation analyses of spt and lpt and considers variations in test equipment , penetration resistance , and energy .
it is shown that the method provides a unified approach for assimilating the various published lptspt correlations .
additional spt and lpt data were collected at a sand research site to check the proposed method and to expand the lpt database .
the observed and predicted correlation factors are shown to be in good agreement .
the proposed correlation method will be useful as a logical framework for the comparison of lpt data collected throughout the world .
additional research will be required to extend this procedure to gravel sites .
the tetrasaccharide epitope , b-d-tyvp(1&#91;image&#93;3)b-d-galnacp(1&#91;image&#93;4)&#91;a-l-fucp(1&#91;image&#93;3)&#93;b-d-glcnacp (1) is the major constituent of the n-glycan expressed on the cell surface of the parasite trichinella spiralis .
two monoclonal antibodies ( mabs 9d4 and 18h1 ) that protect rats against infection by t. spiralis bind the terminal disaccharide epitope b-d-tyvp(1&#91;image&#93;3)b-d-galnacp conjugated to bsa .
the syntheses of disaccharide congeners containing mono-deoxy , mono-methyl , as well as modifications to replace the acetamido group are reported .
these target disaccharides were assayed for binding to the protective mabs .
for each antibody different clusters of three hydroxyl groups , that include c-2 and c-4 of tyvelose and for 18h1 , the galnac acetamido group , provide the key polar interactions with the antibody binding sites .
mapping of the sites by functional group replacement revealed a similar pattern of recognition for the dideoxyhexose by the two mabs while each recognizes distinct surfaces of the galnac residue .
consequently although both antibodies bury the 4-oh of tyvelose , the principal contact surface occurs on opposite sides of the 3,6-dideoxyhexose .
the primary goal of this research was to determine whether the use of methanol in a full-scale sequencing batch reactor ( sbr ) affected the subsequent aerobic sludge digester performance .
the methanol injection into an experimental sbr resulted in a significant increase in the solids level in the sbr , increased wasting into the digesters , and a lower sludge age .
when the methanol dosage in the sbr was 81 l/d , the dissolved oxygen level in the subsequent aerobic digesters became inadequate for proper digestion .
the net result was a drop in solids reduction efficiency .
however , the methanol injection appeared to have no effect on the dewaterability of the digested sludge , as samples from the experimental and control units had very similar capillary suction time ( cst ) results .
it was found that the dewaterability was affected not only by the total suspended solids concentration of the digested sludge , but even more by the temperature of the digested sludge , through a change in filtrate viscosity .
this paper considers competition among cork oaks ( quercus suber l. ) at three plots in two representative portuguese stands .
it uses spatial point pattern functions to describe densities and quantify differences among stands .
relations between cork oak characteristics and indices measuring intertree competition are modeled .
tree competition has a significant effect on tree crown characteristics .
in particular , cork oaks with much competition have smaller and more elongated crowns .
a standard model that relates crown diameter with diameter at breast height was improved .
the r2 value increased from 0.53 to 0.63 by including a crown shape parameter and competition indices .
clonal propagation and limited dispersal of seeds lead to genetic population structures in which most potential mates are relatives .
if the species suffers from inbreeding depression or is self-incompatible , the number of seeds matured per fruit may be limited by the lack of outcrossing by unrelated pollen .
we tested for distance-related genetic structure by hand-pollinating plants at increasing distances and measuring fruit set ( berries/pollinated flowers ) and seed number per fruit in natural populations of bilberry ( vaccinium myrtillus l. ) and lingonberry ( vaccinium vitis-idaea l. ) .
bagging of the flower buds without natural ( pollination by insects ) or hand-pollination yielded almost no fruit or seed , suggesting that the species are obligately insect pollinated .
self-pollination led to a significant reduction in seed number per fruit and increased seed abortion compared with cross-pollination .
moreover , seed number increased with increasing distance between the pollen donor and pollen recipient .
flight distances of bumblebees were estimated for bilberry by monitoring between-flower and , for lingonberry , between-inflorescence flight distances .
about 90 % of all flights were at distances of less than 1 m. at this distance , we observed less than the maximum seed number per fruit in hand-pollinations in both study species .
consequently , clonal growth is likely to be an important factor that constrains fruit and seed number in these species .
some imidazolidine-2,4-dione ( hydantoin ) and thiazolidine-2,4-dione ( tzd ) derivatives with a 1h-pyrrol-2-ylmethylene substituent at the 5-position ( 18 ) have been synthesized via an aldol condensation reaction .
a mixture of z- and e- stereoisomers was obtained , as confirmed by hplc and nmr studies .
assignment of the stereochemistry was achieved through chemical shift knowledge , noe , and 3jh,c data .
the conformation of the molecules depends on the configuration at the double bond .
high-elevation red spruce ( picea rubens sarg. )  fraser fir ( abies fraseri ( pursh ) poir. ) forests of the southern appalachians exhibit considerable spatial heterogeneity in structure , and possibly in n uptake , because of a combination of natural disturbances and heavy fir mortality caused by infestations of the exotic balsam woolly adelgid ( adelges piceae ratz ) .
the objectives of this study are to determine spatial variability in tree n uptake in a small high-elevation catchment in the great smoky mountains national park , compare outcomes among calculation methods , and assess the influence of stand and landscape properties on n uptake .
tree n uptake is estimated for fifty 20 × 20 m plots in the noland divide watershed ( ndw ) .
overstory n uptake varies spatially within ndw , with a cv of 941 % depending on the calculation method .
variability among methods is even higher , with an almost 15-fold difference between the smallest and largest average overstory uptake estimate ( 5 vs. 74 kg·ha1·year1 ) .
only 5 and 3 kg·ha1·year1 of n is sequestered in wood and foliar increment , respectively , while 36 kg·ha1 of n returns annually as aboveground litterfall .
uptake and its components are correlated with measures of stand structure but not with elevation or aspect .
the effect of two different thermal units ( flame and hot steam ) and three types of mulch on the percentage of weeds killed was studied in a series of experiments over 2 years .
the results suggest that a driving speed of 2 km/h kills the highest percentage of weeds , and for weed species with unprotected growth points and thin leaves , the first flame application can completely kill weeds with &lt;6 leaves .
however , a second or third flame application is required for those with 6 or more leaves .
the hot steam method is effective when it is applied twice , with the second application 1 week after the first .
however , there is room for improving its technology to make it cost effective for large-scale applications .
mulches after chemical herbicide application are effective for controlling weeds .
however , mulching cannot be recommended with flaming because of fire hazard .
the effectiveness of herbicide depends on the weed species and on whether the same herbicide was used in the preceding years .
compared to using herbicide with mulching , herbicide alone was less effective in controlling weeds and more costly in terms of cost per hectare and the environment .
the interaction of peptide ligands with their associated g-protein-coupled receptors has been examined by a number of different experimental approaches over the years .
we have been developing an approach utilizing high-resolution nmr to determine the structural features of the peptide ligand , well-designed fragments of the receptor , and the ligandreceptor complexes formed upon titration of the peptide hormone .
the results from these investigations provide evidence for a membrane-associated pathway for the initial interaction of peptide ligands with the receptor .
heer , our results from the investigation of the interaction of cck-8 with the cck1 receptor are described .
our spectroscopic results clearly show that both cck-8 and the regions of cck1 with which it interacts are closely associated with the zwitterionic interface of the lipids utilized in our solution spectroscopic studies .
we investigated the electron excitation of the fine-structure levels of the 3p ground state and the first excited 1d state of the first four elements of group iv : carbon , silicon , germanium , and tin .
these calculations were carried out in the jj coupling scheme using the relativistic distorted-wave method .
results are presented for the differential cross sections and spin-polarization parameters for incident electron energies of 25 and 40 ev. pacs nos. : 34.80dp , 34.80nz
chronically hypoxic rats ( exposed to 5000 m elevation for 3 weeks ) develop pulmonary hypertension ( ph ) that is reversed upon return to normoxia and is blocked by bradykinin ( bk ) antagonist b9430 treatment ( 100 µg/kg s.c. three times per week ) .
between weeks 1 and 2 of treatment , there is increased apoptotic ec death and caspase-3 activity .
the combination of hypoxia with vegfr-1 and -2 blockade appears to cause death of normal lung ec and proliferation of an apoptosis-resistant proliferating ec phenotype .
the pap correlated with the right ventricular mass .
pulmonary arteries of rats treated with z-asp and bk antagonist b9430 had a marked reduction of intravascular ec , yet there was still evidence of medial muscular hypertrophy , similar to that observed in chronically hypoxic rats not treated with su5416 .
we conclude that ec death induced by vegfr-2 blockade with su5416 may trigger an ec selection process that allows for the expansion of apoptosis-resistant ec , possibly driven by mechanisms independent of vegf and vegfr-2 .
adenosine is a physiologically important nucleoside in the cardiovascular system where it can act as a cardioprotectant and modulator of energy usage .
adenosine transporters ( ats ) modulate cellular adenosine levels , which , in turn , can affect a number of processes such as receptor activation and glucose uptake , but their role in cardiac physiology is poorly understood .
therefore , we have developed a new cell model by determining various adenosine-related characteristics of hl-1 , an immortalized atrial cardiomyocyte murine cell line .
adenosine uptake in hl-1 cells is sodium independent , saturable , and inhibitable by nucleoside transport inhibitors ( nitrobenzylthioinosine ( nbti ) , dipyridamole , dilazep ) .
reverse transcription  polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed that hl-1 cells possess mouse equilibrative nucleoside transporters 1 and 2 ( ment1 , ment2 ) and kinetic analyses indicate moderate-affinity ( km = 51.3 ± 12.9 mm ) , nbti-sensitive adenosine transport .
nbti binds at a high-affinity single site ( bmax = 520 ± 10 fmol/mg protein , kd = 0.11 ± 0.04 nm , 1.6 × 105 nbti-binding sites/cell ) .
hl-1 cells possess adenosine receptor , metabolic enzyme , protein kinase c isoform , and insulin-stimulated glucose transport profiles that match normal mouse heart .
therefore , hl-1 is an excellent model to study ats within cardiomyocytes and the first model for evaluating in detail the role of the ats in modulating effects of adenosine .
an investigation of the heart morphology of 8 male and 15 female hooded seals ( cystophora cristata ) revealed that the heart is proportionately large and the aortic bulb is larger than that reported for most seals .
hooded seals of all ages have large hearts ( 0.64 % of the body mass ) and the right ventricle is proportionately longer and more muscular than reported for other seals .
the bulb of the ascending aorta shows the large-diameter characteristic of seals capable of making long deep dives , and is constricted to a diameter of less than one-third in the descending aorta .
in addition , the ascending aorta has a much greater concentration of elastin fibers than does the descending aorta .
in combination with the large right ventricle , these features probably serve to increase lung perfusion during the hooded seal &apos;s surface recovery , and to maintain a high blood pressure throughout the cardiac cycle during diving bradycardia .
that there was no substantive difference in the heart morphology of pups , yearlings , and adults , suggests that these features are important in the development of diving behavior , and agrees with the rapid behavioral and physiological development of hooded seal neonates .
the backbone of any successful integrated traffic management system ( itms ) for a metropolis is reliable , accurate , and real-time data .
travel time , speed , and delay are three of the most important factors used in itms for quantifying , monitoring , and controlling congestion .
global positioning systems ( gps ) have recently become available for civil applications .
as it provides real-time spatial and time measurements , it has an increasing use in conducting different transportation studies .
this paper presents the application of gps in collecting travel time , speed , and delay information on 64 major roads throughout the state of delaware .
a comparative statistical analysis was performed on data collected by gps method , with data collected simultaneously by the conventional method .
the gps data proved to be at least as accurate as the data collected by conventional methods and was 50 % more efficient in terms of manpower .
moreover , the sample-size requirement was determined to maintain 95 % confidence level throughout the controlled test .
statistical trend analyses for the data collected from 1997 to 2000 are also presented and applications in the overall itms area are discussed .
a set of 79 previously mapped bean ( phaseolus vulgaris ) genomic ( bng ) clones were partially sequenced .
blast database searches detected homologies between 59 of these clones and genes from a variety of plants , especially arabidopsis thaliana .
some matches in the database to the bng clones included a putative p-glycoprotein  abc transporter from arabidopsis , an early nodulin-binding protein ( enbp1 ) from medicago truncatula , a lon-protease protein from spinach , a branched-chain amino-acid aminotransferase from arabidopis , and a vacuolar sorting receptor ( bp-80 ) from pisum sativum .
additional matches were found for genes involved in isoprenoid biosynthesis , sulfur metabolism , proline biosynthesis , and floral development .
sequence tagged site ( stss ) were produced for 16 of the clones , 2 of which contain simple sequence repeats ( ssrs ) .
polymorphisms were detected for six of the stss .
the effect of epidermal growth factor ( egf ) on the cellular and villous distribution of the sugar transporter sglt-1 was examined .
sglt-1 was measured in membrane fractions by western immunoblot or localized along the villuscrypt axis by immunofluorescent microscopy .
egf increased bbmv sglt-1 content compared with paired controls .
seedlings from families 2 and 3 grew larger than seedlings from family 1 , which allocated relatively more dry matter to roots .
growth of the three families interacted with soil ph so that family 1 was largest at ph 7 , but families 2 and 3 were largest at ph 6 .
seedling boron (b) uptake was reduced by increasing ph and by the ca(no3)2 fertilizer .
during courtship , the male drosophila melanogaster ( diptera , drosophilidae ) emits two kinds of acoustic signals by means of wing vibrations oriented towards the female : pulse song and sine song .
to examine the roles of these two song types , different experimental signals were played back to single pairs of flies ( with the males made mute by wing removal ) .
to preserve the natural pattern of sound emission , all the experimental signals were constructed from a representative complete song that included both the pulse and the sine components , recorded during a successful courtship .
the first experiment showed that playback of a natural complete song restored to wingless males courtship success comparable to that of normal winged males .
in the second experiment , in which we distinguished between the effects of pulse song and sine song , pulse song alone was sufficient to stimulate matings between wingless males and virgin females ; sine song had a less stimulating effect .
purcell proposes that the potential energy u of a localized distribution of electrostatic charge has physical significance only as the total energy of the whole configuration .
this result supports the feynman point of view .
basal reiteration ( epicormic shoot production from older branch axes ) occurred continuously and repeatedly in branches of 450-year-old pseudotsuga menziesii ( mirb . )
basal reiteration occurred mostly from primary and secondary branch axes but also occurred from higher-order axes if lower-order axes had died back .
basal reiteration occurred repeatedly producing two to six generations of reiterated axes within branches .
less than 22.5 % of foliated shoots on branches were produced by sequential branching of the primary axis .
basal reiteration also maintained a constant rate of new shoot production within the branch .
growth-ring analysis showed that basal reiteration occurred over a wide range of axis ages ( 558 years ) .
in conjunction with previous studies , we showed that adaptive reiteration of various architectural units by epicormic shoot production is an inherent process that maintains foliage in the crown of old p. menziesii trees .
significant variations were found between locations and according to the main diet ( average ranging between 1.1 and 2.4 cubs/female ) .
fish and crayfish exhibited a seasonal fluctuation , with a maximum density of biomass between the end of spring and the end of summer and minimum densities in winter .
water was always flowing in the pyrenees and prepyrenees rivers ; however , in mediterranean rivers , important periods of drought were observed , concentrated especially in summer and some winters .
timing of birds corresponded to variation in abundance of food ( energy needs ) and water resources in space and time .
the presence of adequate prey species for the cubs ( ebro &apos;s barbel ( barbus graellsii and barbus haasi ) and american crayfish ( procambarus clarkii ) in our study area ) plays an important role .
interannual variations in food can affect the otter &apos;s reproductive cycle and breeding success .
u-pb geochronology , palynology , and lithostratigraphy were employed on the late cretaceous rocks in southern alberta and montana to solve litho- and chronostratigraphic correlation problems .
in north-central montana , the telegraph creek formation and virgelle and deadhorse coulee members are equivalent in depositional environments and time to those of the milk river formation in southern alberta .
the upper eagle member , however , has no time- or facies-equivalent rocks around writing-on-stone provincial park , but is time equivalent to the alderson member of the lea park formation in southeastern alberta .
a hiatus of ~2.5 ma is present between the top of the milk river formation in the outcrop area and the basal beds of the pakowki formation .
the pakowki transgression occurred at around 81.0 ma based on a upb zircon age of 80.7 ± 0.2 ma from bentonite beds just above the bottom of the pakowki formation in southern alberta .
this age agrees with previous ages of 80.7 ± 0.6 ma for the ardmore bentonite beds and ~81.0 ma for the claggett transgression in southern montana .
in a deformable granular medium , shear deformation results in a change in pore volume , thereby causing a change in permeability .
in previous studies , it is assumed that the change in absolute permeability is a function of porosity or volumetric strain , which in turn is a function of the mean or minimum effective stress .
in such semi-empirical correlations , the changes in permeability are equal in all directions , even though the changes in strains are different in each direction .
this paper proposes a new model accounting for permeability anisotropy induced by strains in deformable porous media .
this model is derived from the well-known phenomenological kozenycarman equation with some modifications .
it was proven that tensor parameters embedded in the kozenycarman equation ( hydraulic radius and tortuosity of flow channels ) can be expressed in terms of principal strains for granular assemblies of idealized packings .
this approach allows one to formulate the evolution of changes in permeability in three directions under continuous shearing .
the model explicitly states that the permeability changes are anisotropic , dependent on the induced strains .
a comparison between experimental data and predicted results is presented to show the validity of the proposed model .
litterfall is an important ecological process in forest ecosystem functioning .
some attempts have been made to develop spatially explicit models of litterfall , but wind influence has never been included .
therefore , we studied the effect of wind on litterfall in an intimately mixed birch-oak forest using tree diameter and position as input data .
after testing a litterfall model that assumed isotropic leaf dispersal , an anisotropic dispersal module was developed to account for wind influence .
using leaf fall data of 104 litter traps , isotropic and anisotropic models were optimized for silver birch ( betula pendula roth ) , pedunculate oak ( quercus robur l. ) , and red oak ( quercus rubra l. ) and model quality was compared .
the anisotropic leaf litterfall model proved to be relevant because (i) the estimated litterfall directions corresponded very well to prevailing wind directions during leaf fall and ( ii ) including directionality significantly increased the goodness of fit of the models for both oak species but not for birch .
consequently , prevailing wind directions during leaf fall affected leaf dispersal in a broad-leaved deciduous forest .
insight into the spatial variability of the litter layer in forest ecosystems can benefit from the improved understanding of small-scale litterfall processes .
sudbury breccias are unusual clastmatrix rock bodies formed in abundance around the sudbury igneous complex , the most obvious manifestation of a major impact event at sudbury .
at whitefish falls , ~70 km southwest of sudbury , similar breccias consisting of clasts of argillite and amphibolite dyke enclosed in a fine-grained matrix of host rock are developed in metamorphosed argillites of the huronian supergroup .
pre-brecciation brittle textures in the host argillite and breccia clasts , such as layer-parallel foliation offset by cataclastic fractures , suggest that the host rock was entirely competent prior to brecciation .
one composite penetrative foliation and its associated ductile folding were also formed in the argillite host prior to brecciation .
post-brecciation ductile deformation produced a regionally dominant eastwest-trending foliation , and two late-stage folding events , and indicate a syn-penokean age of brecciation .
the breccias at whitefish falls are enriched in ferromagnesian minerals compared to adjacent , embayed and partially digested , host rock .
flow-foliated breccia matrices surround a highly rounded clast phase .
these features are characteristic of impact-related pseudotachylyte , formed during extreme cataclasis and friction melting of the impacted host rock .
we propose that these breccias formed by injection of a high-strain , pseudotachylytic melt , triggered by the sudbury impact event , and focused along a blind superfault , coincident with a post-penokean high-strain zone .
the increment of activity and solubility in 1,4-dioxane of lipase b from candida antarctica , lipase from pseudomonas cepacia , and subtilisin , were investigated as a function of the methoxypoly(ethylene glycol)protein ( pegprotein ) ratio employed during lyophilization .
both activity and solubility markedly increased as the pegprotein ratio was increased .
the increment of activity at low pegprotein ratios , however , was much higher than that of solubility .
these data suggest that the peg-induced activation effect is due mainly to a lyoprotection effect rather than to relaxation of diffusional limitations .
the effects of dimethyl sulfoxide ( dmso ) on creatine kinase ( ck ) conformation and enzymatic activity were studied by measuring activity changes , aggregation , and fluorescence spectra .
the unfolding of ck was an irreversible process in the dmso solutions .
higher concentrations of dmso affected the enzyme structure but not its active site .
the exposure of hydrophobic surfaces was a primary reason for the protein aggregation .
in addition , 25 populations from other parts of eurasia were studied for comparison .
thus , no inferences about the direction of postglacial migration could be made .
obviously , migration and gene flow must have taken place in a manner capable of randomising the distribution of alleles .
however , there were clear differences in levels and structuring of the variation between the two regions .
levels of variation , both in terms of genetic diversity and allelic richness , were lower in northern sweden as compared with southern sweden .
in contrast , different measures of geographic structure all showed higher levels of population differentiation in the northern region .
mucosal membranes of foregut epithelia of aplysia californica contain a sodium/sulfate symporter .
dexamethasone inhibited the absorptive activity of the sodium/sulfate symporter , whereas amiloride had no effect on it .
it appears that glucocorticoids or their molluscan equivalent play a role in the overall regulation of sulfate homeostasis by the a. californica gut .
the properties of tris(4,5-di-n-propyl-2-imidazolyl)phosphinem2+ complexes ( 3m2+ , m = zn , co ) in neutral micellar media of brij-35 and triton x-100 have been studied in water with respect to their quantitative potenti metric titration , co2+-visible absorption spectra , and ability of the 3zn2+ complex to promote the hydrolysis of the activated ester , p-nitrophenyl acetate ( pnpa ) .
potentiometric titration of the 3m2+(cio4)2 complexes in 20 mm brij-35 media yields a steep titration curve indicative of the cooperative consumption of two hydroxides , with computed pk1 and pk2 values of 8.75 and 6.25 , respectively , and the midpoint of the titration curve ( pkapp ) being 7.50 .
a similar titration of the co2+ complex also indicates cooperative consumption of two ho , and this is tied to the formation of a 4- or 5-coordinate complex , pkapp ~ 7.37.4 .
the cooperativity is explained in terms of sequential replacement of the two cio4 ions associated with the 3m2+ to eventually yield 3m2+ho/(ho(h2o)n ) having the first hydroxide ligated to the metal ion and the second associated as an ion pair .
the 3zn2+ complex catalyzes the hydrolysis of pnpa in 20 mm brij-35 and 40 mm triton x-100 .
plots of the observed second order rate constant ( k2 ) vs. ph in brij-35 increase linearly with ph and plateau to a value of k2max = 0.86 m1 s1 , with a kinetic pka of 8.7 .
these data are analyzed by a process wherein the 3zn2+ho is kinetically active in the rate-limiting step of the reaction , while the ion-paired ( ho(h2o)n ) exists as a spectator to the slow step , possibly promoting rapid breakdown of a tetrahedral intermediate .
analysis of the kinetic data in terms of a model that accounts for the partitioning of pnpa between water and hydrophobic micellar pseudophase indicates that the second-order rate constant of the micelle-bound ester is augmented by 45-fold due to loading of the pnpa substrate into the micelle .
a portable freezer was developed to apply frost to branches of large trees to study their growth and recuperation after frost application under natural conditions .
the freezer measures 37.5 × 63.5 × 31.5 cm and weighs approximately 3 kg. it consists of two compartments , a freezing compartment and a dry ice compartment .
the portable freezer provides a ramp-and-soak freezing pattern using a programmable controller .
under these conditions , the cooling and warming rates showed a deviation of less than ±1°c·h1 at a set rate of 2°c·h1 .
freezers were also tested under field conditions on attached branches in mature white spruce ( picea glauca ( moench ) voss ) trees under hardening conditions .
to examine the extent to which stream-resident coastal cutthroat trout ( oncorhynchus clarki ) are limited by food and cover , we manipulated these two factors in a 2 × 2 design using enclosures containing 1-year-old trout in two streams .
during summer , fish receiving food additions experienced an average growth rate of 1.73 % body mass·day1 compared with a rate of 0.022 for unfed fish ( ambient food supply only ) , indicating marked food limitation .
the addition of cover decreased mortality by approximately 50 % in one stream , but survival was high both with and without cover in the other .
there was no interaction of food and cover on growth or survival .
emigration rates were low and were not strongly affected by either factor .
we also used markrecapture modeling to examine whether the 48 % greater mass of fed fish at the end of the experiment improved survival over winter .
fed fish were still 46 % larger than unfed fish by the next spring , but overwinter survival was not explained by body size .
our results show that , during summer , food availability can limit trout growth , and cover , by mediating predation , can limit survival .
specifically , the sdmdsp was evaluated by comparing its yield predictions with corresponding measured values ( n = 44 ) within 19 black spruce plantations .
this result is discussed within the context of residual stand structure variation and response delay from which recommendations for model improvement are derived .
small subunit ribosomal genes were explored using pcrrflp to facilitate the characterization of bacteria cultured from reared fry of the atlantic halibut ( hippoglossus hippoglossus ) .
concern has been expressed about pathogen invasion in larvae lacking a counteracting normal flora that may aid the immune system in producing robust noninfected individuals .
in this study , pure cultured representatives of normal flora that were previously found to be antagonistic towards a pathogenic vibrio sp. were subjected to a whole cell pcr protocol amplifying ~1500 bp of 16s rdna .
amplified dna was digested by alui , bstui , cfoi , and rsai , to generate restriction profiles .
before the isolates were characterized , a survey was performed to test the discriminative efficiency of the rflp .
efficient detection of polymorphism and the resolution of species and subspecies were achieved .
using the rflp on 103 isolates generated as many as 22 genotypes .
based on the restriction profiles , a taxonomic tree incorporating 19 reference strains was constructed .
partial sequencing found this tree to be dominated by g-proteobacteria in clusters of vibrio- , pseudomonas- , and alteromonas-affiliated species .
only nine isolates fell outside these genera , including the three isolates shewanella alga , deleya marina , and marinomonas protea .
these species have not previously been reported as halibut flora .
the most frequently isolated genotype resembled vibrio salmonicida .
we examined the effects of anesthetic , age , and strain on oral glucose tolerance tests ( ogtt , 1 g/kg body weight ) and intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests ( ipgtt , 2 g/kg body weight ) in spontaneously hypertensive ( sh ) and wistar rats .
pentobarbital anesthesia caused an elevation in basal glucose and insulin levels in wistar rats at 9 and 16 weeks of age and in sh rats at 9 weeks .
anesthesia increased the insulin output during an ogtt in both strains of rats while glucose was unchanged .
anesthesia reduced the insulin sensitivity index calculated from the ogtt but not from the ipgtt data .
the age of the rats ( 911 vs. 1618 weeks ) had no effect on the basal glucose or insulin levels , but older wistar rats had a greater insulin output following oral glucose and older sh rats had a greater insulin output following intraperitoneal glucose .
on the basis of the insulin sensitivity index , sh rats were clearly more insulin resistant than age-matched wistar rats .
the sh rats also had higher basal insulin levels , as well as higher insulin output , following both glucose challenges .
in summary , sh rats are more insulin resistant than wistar rats , and anesthesia , which elevated basal glucose and insulin levels and increased the insulin output in response to a glucose challenge , may increase insulin resistance .
as much as 40 % of live biomass in coniferous forests is located belowground , yet the effect of tree density on biomass allocation is poorly understood .
we developed allometric equations using traditional harvesting techniques to estimate coarse root biomass for &#91;image&#93;13-year-old postfire lodgepole pine trees ( pinus contorta dougl. ex loud. var. latifolia engelm. ) .
we then used these equations , plus estimates of fine root and aboveground biomass , to estimate total tree biomass and belowground to aboveground biomass ratios in young postfire lodgepole pine stands with a wide range of tree densities .
belowground biomass allocation increased with tree density , but the increase was largely determined by inherent differences associated with tree size , not competition .
stand biomass in trees ranged from 46 to 5529 kg·ha1 belowground , from 176 to 9400 kg·ha1 aboveground , and from 222 to 13 685 kg·ha1 for total biomass .
molecular techniques have allowed researchers studying mating systems to determine the identity of extra-pair sires , providing more accurate measures of individual realized reproductive success .
yet , an existing problem in such studies is the inability to assign paternity to individuals that have not been captured .
this frequently arises when only a proportion of the population is sampled or when visitors from outside the study area have access to the breeding population .
it is therefore difficult to assign paternity in situations where not all candidate sires are sampled because some assignments may be incorrect , especially when using a likelihood-based approach .
this study outlines a method that combines two different programs , gerud 1.0 and cervus 2.0 , to increase confidence in paternity assignment .
the benefit of using these programs in conjunction is that gerud 1.0 can reconstruct genotypes of males that are not sampled in families where the female was sampled , and cervus 2.0 can use this information to better assign paternity because more information is provided .
we show how applying this method to least flycatchers ( empidonax minimus ) , a sub-oscine bird with an open mating system , substantially increases confidence in paternity assignments .
in nature , social groups of animals are typically nonrandom associations of individuals .
such group associations may in part be based on social familiarity among individuals , acquired through repeated past encounters and behavioral experiences with each other .
the factors that potentially affect the tendency to associate with familiar individuals remain poorly understood .
when tested shortly after being collected in the field , neither males nor females clearly preferred to shoal with familiar same-sex conspecifics ( collected from the same pool in the river ) over unfamiliar ones ( from different pools ) .
importantly , our results differ from those previously reported for guppies originating from the same population as ours and for a high predation risk population in trinidad , suggesting that the development of social familiarity and its role in the formation of shoals in nature vary both within and among populations in the guppy .
we provide plausible explanations for these observed populational differences in shoaling preferences in the guppy and discuss certain ecological factors that may affect the development and expression of shoaling preferences based on familiarity in nature .
current forest management guidelines require the extensive use of stand level approaches to minimize impacts on aquatic ecosystems .
as forest management practices in canada evolve from a sustained yield , timber-based focus to a more sustainable approach , the need has been recognized for the addition of landscape or watershed-based management strategies to address the cumulative effects of management practices on aquatic systems .
additional concerns expressed by regulatory agencies have resulted in the need to restrict cumulative harvest rates and monitor harvest levels for a forest management operation in manitoba .
present riparian management practices and watershed analysis procedures are reviewed for the operations of louisiana-pacific canada in manitoba .
requirements are outlined for multi-scale indicators and research to support the development of a watershed-based planning approach for use in forest management planning and monitoring .
the development of this watershed-based approach is linked to the forest watershed and riparian disturbance ( forward ) project .
foxes were categorized as rural ( agricultural habitat , coyotes present ) , urban ( urban habitat , coyotes absent ) , or from an agricultural research facility at the university of illinois ( south farms , agricultural habitat , coyotes absent ) .
rural foxes had higher fur isotopic values ( d13c and d15n ) than rural coyotes , indicating that coyotes caused foxes to consume prey items from higher trophic levels and eat more c4 plants .
urban foxes had lower isotopic values ( d13c and d15n ) than south farms foxes , suggesting that habitat use partly determined fox diets ; foxes in urbanized habitats consumed prey at lower trophic levels within a largely c3 plant based food web .
models of competitive exclusion by coyotes were better predictors of fox long-term diets , including pup rearing , while habitat use models predicted fox diets on a narrower timescale .
competitive exclusion by coyotes might be an important factor explaining the decline of foxes in the intense farming areas of illinois .
various patterns of harvest in forests influence the length of road and number of stream crossings required .
snags are removed directly by harvesting , but they are also removed along road and opening edges to ensure worker safety .
to assess the potential impacts of rate of harvest and pattern of harvest in an old-forest-dominated montane landscape , we developed a spatially explicit landscape dynamics model , which includes submodels for snag removal , harvesting activities , and access management .
the model assesses the amount of new road construction and number of streams crossed by new roads , as well as changes in snag density and configuration across the landscape over a time horizon of several decades , in response to various harvesting patterns .
we estimated that a dispersed 40-ha cutblock harvest pattern required about one-third more kilometers of new road over a 50-year period and removal of up to 70 % more snags per hectare of harvest for safety purposes , compared with a harvest pattern based on natural-patch size distribution .
each 20 % increase in stand-level retention resulted in a roughly equivalent increase in new road required .
up to eight times as many snags were removed per hectare of harvest for safety purposes at a stand-level retention of 70 % than at a stand-level retention of 10 % .
the model appears to be an effective tool for determining the future impact of various harvest-pattern options on a number of important indicators of ecological impact .
quantifying forest net primary production ( npp ) is critical to understanding the global carbon cycle because forests are responsible for a large portion of the total terrestrial npp .
the objectives of this study were to measure above ground npp ( nppa ) for a land surface in northern wisconsin , examine the spatial patterns of nppa and its components , and correlate nppa with vegetation cover types and leaf area index .
mean nppa for aspen , hardwoods , mixed forest , upland conifers , nonforested wetlands , and forested wetlands was 7.8 , 7.2 , 5.7 , 4.9 , 5.0 , and 4.5 t dry mass·ha1·year1 , respectively .
there were significant ( p = 0.01 ) spatial patterns in wood , foliage , and understory npp components and nppa ( p = 0.03 ) when the vegetation cover type was included in the model .
the spatial range estimates for the three npp components and nppa differed significantly from each other , suggesting that different factors are influencing the components of npp .
nppa was significantly correlated with leaf area index ( p = 0.01 ) for the major vegetation cover types .
the mean nppa for the 3 km × 2 km site was 5.8 t dry mass·ha1·year1 .
local species richness ( lsr ) in stream fish assemblages is related to both local habitat conditions and stream spatial position .
in this study , we examined the within-basin distribution of lsr in the upper saône river ( france ) .
we describe the longitudinal patterns in lsr and assess the relative effects of both local habitat and spatial ( upstream and downstream ) influences on species richness .
we showed that among the different local habitat variables , only stream width and gradient significantly influenced lsr .
spatial factors also influenced the within-basin distribution of lsr and resulted in spatial autocorrelation , highlighting contagious biotic processes in structuring stream fish assemblages .
the spatial autocorrelation was only significant downstream ( from 4th- to 7th-order streams ) , suggesting that the relative importance of local habitat and biotic processes may depend on the position along the longitudinal gradient .
a geomembrane  compacted clay composite liner system used to contain municipal solid waste ( msw ) landfill leachate for 14 years is evaluated .
field observations of the geomembrane revealed many defects , including holes , patches , and cracks .
physical , chemical , and mechanical tests conducted on samples collected from five different locations of the liner suggest that samples continuously exposed to sunlight and high temperatures experienced more degradation compared to samples that were covered by leachate or soil .
sorption and diffusion tests revealed that the permeation coefficients of volatile organic compounds were in the range of 4 × 1012 to 6 × 1011 m2/s and that , with respect to these parameters , there was no significant difference between samples with different exposure levels .
however , the permeation coefficients were between four and five times lower than values obtained for unaged hdpe geomembranes typical of present day production .
contaminant modeling of the entire lagoon liner suggests that the geomembrane liner most likely stopped being effective as a contaminant barrier to ionic species sometime between 0 and 4 years after the installation .
ecosystem classification identifies interrelationships within and among the geomorphology , soils , and vegetation that converge to form ecosystems across forest landscapes .
we developed a multifactor ecosystem classification system for a 13 000 ha southern appalachian landscape acquired in 1998 by the south carolina department of natural resources .
using a combination of multivariate analyses , we distinguished five ecosystem types ranging from xeric oak ( quercus spp. ) to mesic eastern hemlock ( tsuga canadensis ( l. ) carrière ) ecosystems .
ecosystems segregated along geomorphic gradients influencing potential moisture availability , with soil properties such as solum thickness distinguishing among ecosystems occupying similar topographic positions .
our results suggest that different combinations of geomorphic and soil factors interact to form similar ecosystems across the landscape , and a given environmental factor can impact ecosystem development at some constituent sites of an ecosystem type but not at other sites .
a regional comparison of ecosystem classifications indicates that environmental variables important for distinguishing ecosystems in the southern appalachians vary , with jocassee gorges characterized by unique suites of environmental complexes .
our study supports the contention that the strengths of ecosystem classification are providing (i) comprehensive information on the interrelationships among ecosystem components , ( ii ) a foundation from which to develop ecologically based forest management plans , and ( iii ) an ecological framework in which to conduct future research on specific ecosystem components or processes .
the study organisms were inactivated both in the biofilm and in the water column .
water column data showed that biofilm released culturable heterotrophs and endospores into the water column throughout the 72 h evaluation period at all chlorine levels evaluated .
the research objective was to test the hypothesis that chronic prenatal ethanol exposure , via maternal ethanol administration , produces differential time course of decreased linear density of hippocampal ca1 pyramidal cells and cerebellar purkinje cells .
ethanol treatment , compared with isocaloric-sucrose/pair-feeding and water treatments , decreased brain , hippocampal , and cerebellar weights at gd 62 , pd 1 , pd 5 , and pd 12 .
hippocampal ca1 pyramidal cell linear density and cerebellar purkinje cell linear density were unaffected at gd 62 .
ethanol treatment produced 25 , 30 , and 30 % decreases in linear density of hippocampal ca1 pyramidal cells at pd 1 , pd 5 , and pd 12 , respectively , and a 30 % decrease in linear density of cerebellar purkinje cells at pd 12 only .
at pd 5 , purkinje cell profile linear density remained unaffected ; however , ethanol treatment appeared to increase linear density of apoptotic purkinje cell nuclei , as determined by a modified tunel method .
the data demonstrate that chronic prenatal ethanol exposure produces apparent differential time course of decreased linear density of hippocampal ca1 pyramidal cells and cerebellar purkinje cells in the developing guinea pig .
the series of compounds (o-ch3sc6h4)ch2eph3 ( e = si (1) , ge (2) , sn (3) , and pb (4) ) have been synthesized and characterized by nmr spectroscopy and by single crystal x-ray diffraction .
compound 4 has a pb-s distance of 3.953 å ( 91 % of î£ vdw radii ) .
the structure of the grignard coupling product &#91;o-(sch3)c6h4ch2&#93;2 is also reported .
root cohesion is an important parameter governing slope stability in steep forested terrain .
forest harvesting impacts root cohesion , and although the temporal effects have been noted , this dynamic parameter is often assumed to be spatially uniform .
a model was developed to simulate the variation in root cohesion on a hillslope resulting from various forest management treatments .
the model combines physical data on the horizontal rooting distribution of douglas-fir ( pseudotsuga menziesii ( mirb . )
franco var. menziesii ) together with a temporal relation of root cohesion decay .
harvesting methods examined include clear-cutting , single-tree selection cutting , and strip-cutting .
model outputs are analyzed qualitatively for regions of root cohesion minima and quantitatively for the average root cohesion within the simulated hillslope .
in contrast , the minimum root cohesion following clear-cutting declined to 38 % of the preharvest value .
selection and strip-cutting scenarios resulted in smaller areas of reduced root cohesion that were adjacent to areas with high root cohesion .
such partial cutting methods shorten the period of reduced root cohesion following timber harvesting compared with clear-cutting .
the changes in blood pressure , cardiac output , and total peripheral conductance evoked by the novel hypotensive arginine vasopressin ( avp ) - like peptide , d(ch2)5&#91;d-tyr(et)2,arg3,val4,arg7,eda9&#93;avp ( hypo-avp ) , were recorded in conscious unrestrained spraguedawley rats implanted with radiotelemetry pressure transducers and ultrasonic transit-time flowprobes .
intravenous infusions of 0.6 , 1.0 , 2.0 , and 4.0 mg·kg1·min1 of hypo-avp evoked dose-related decreases in blood pressure .
at the lowest dose of 0.6 mg·kg1·min1 , the fall in blood pressure was associated with a small but significant increase in total peripheral conductance .
cardiac output was unchanged .
in contrast , at the three higher doses of 1.0 , 2.0 , and 4.0 mg·kg1·min1 , the fall in blood pressure was related to a dramatic fall in cardiac output .
indeed , total peripheral conductance decreased , preventing blood pressure from falling further .
these hemo dynamic findings should help to direct future research into the mechanism of the putative hypotensive property of vaso pressin , a property that attenuates the well established blood pressure elevating actions of the peptide .
the soft-bodied nature of the platyhelminths is due largely to the structure of the body wall and its lack of sclerotic elements such as cuticle .
free-living members , i.e. , most turbellarians , show considerable variety , but the basic form of the body wall comprises a simple ciliated epithelium overlying a network of muscles .
we illustrate this body wall structure in a representative typhloplanoid rhabditophoran and discuss variations in representatives of the acoela , catenulida , and other free-living rhabditophorans .
the major parasitic groups of platyhelminths , the rhabditophoran neodermata , follow a developmental pattern that replaces a similar ciliated epidermis in a larval stage with a specialized epidermis called a neodermis , which is assumed to be key to their success as parasites .
this neodermis consists of a syncytium that covers the body in a continuous sheet connected to perikarya that lie below the body wall musculature .
the neodermis can be seen as a special adaptation of a developmental mechanism common to all platyhelminths , in which epidermal growth and renewal are accomplished by replacement cells originating beneath the body wall .
the cell type responsible for all cell renewal , including body wall renewal , in platyhelminths is the neoblast , and its presence may be the one autapomorphic character that unites all taxonomic groups of platyhelminths .
old-growth forests are those that meet some threshold(s) determined by a scientific and political process .
the main issue is what criteria to use to determine these thresholds ; they must be practical enough to allow managers to delimit and manage old-growth stands in the field .
we advocate uniting these two and using &quot; primary forest &quot; , also called &quot; natural heritage forest &quot; , as the criterion for delimiting old growth in regions where primary forest still exists .
this criterion recognizes that the stage of development with big , old trees is part of a cycle of development , and it is necessary to have all the parts to continue to produce new examples of the older stages .
the best available second-growth stands can be used in regions where primary forests are not available .
alternatively , threshold criteria for delimiting old growth can be based on tree size and age , but arbitrary criteria based on human size and age scales should be avoided in favor of criteria that specify stands dominated by trees relatively large and old for the species and site .
such criteria allow for old growth to occur across a variety of levels of site productivity , with trees of widely varying stature and with varying life-history characteristics , such as longevity , shade tolerance , and successional status .
in any case , managers and scientists should work together to make sure that definitions work in the field but also include the ecological processes necessary to maintain the unique biological resources of old growth .
the biological resources present in old growth may help to restore the second-growth landscape and allow reconstitution of forests in new places after global warming .
old-growth forests provide a baseline for comparison of effects of logging and natural disturbance , with respect to resilience to climatic change and disturbance , maintenance of species richness , and natural genetic structure of tree populations , which respond to different selective regimes in old growth and harvested forests .
the species in old-growth remnants , their interactions and the resilience of the system after disturbance are as important or perhaps more so than the age and size of the trees at a given point in time .
the structural features of representative acadian old growth can be understood from the few remaining stands of such forest in the afr and from studies in the closely related forest types of the great lakes  st. lawrence forest region of canada and other eastern north american temperate-zone forests .
several hundred years of land clearing for agriculture and timber harvesting has eliminated most of the old-growth forests in the maritime provinces of canada .
what little og remains is largely restricted to small , isolated stands , often associated with steep gorges that were inaccessible to harvesting or areas that were otherwise protected or avoided being harvested .
such forests may be considered archetypical of og in the afr .
our objectives were ( i) to describe some of the remaining old-growth forest types and their extent in the afr , ( ii ) to present some perspectives on their role in biodiversity conservation , and ( iii ) to present a basis for developing strategies for conservation , management , and restoration .
recent genetic studies suggest that these old-growth forests were probably a rich source of the genetic diversity required by these tree species to adapt to the environmental ( climatic ) changes that have characterized the north american continent over the past 2 million years of its glacial history .
we tested the hypotheses that potential egg predators , crayfish procambarus nigrocinctus and dytiscid cybister sp. larvae , would accelerate the timing of hatching and that a larval predator , dragonfly naiad anax junius , would delay hatching in the southern leopard frog ( rana sphenocephala ) .
we also tested the hypothesis that differences in response would be proportional to predator lethality .
our results indicate that our hypotheses were partially supported .
the presence of an efficient egg predator ( crayfish ) induces hatching faster than a less efficient predator ( dytiscid larvae ) .
however , the presence of a larval predator ( naiads ) did not delay hatching .
eggs that developed in the presence of egg predators produced hatchlings that were shorter ( total length ) than those reared in the presence of larval predators or those reared in the absence of predators .
we suggest that earlier hatching times should decrease vulnerability to egg predators but result in shorter hatchlings .
three qtls ( gsl-a2a , gsl-f , gsl-b3 ) affected 2-propenyl and explained 78 % of the phenotypic variance in the population .
for total aliphatic glucosinolates , five qtls explained 30 % to 45 % of the total phenotypic variance in the population in different environments .
several qtls ( gsl-a7 and gsl-a3 ) were highly inconsistent in different environments .
a marker-assisted selection strategy based on qtls associated with individual glucosinolates rather than total aliphatic glucosinolates is proposed for b. juncea .
we have used an acousto-optic modulator ( aom ) to impose a frequency-modulated signal on an incident laser beam .
the incident laser beam is focused into the aom where it undergoes bragg diffraction and is then retro-reflected .
the diffracted beam is also retro-reflected so that it is diffracted again by the aom and overlaps the incident beam .
the overlapped beams are frequency shifted with respect to each other .
these features allow us to detect the frequency-modulated signal with high signal-to-noise ratio using heterodyne detection .
since the optical setup is simple and can be made very compact , this device may be ideal for certain forms of high-speed , free-space optical communication .
we demonstrate a 1 mhz data transmission rate in the bragg regime .
we measured the acceptance angle of the device and find that it is limited only by the divergence of the focused laser beam and the divergence of the acoustic waves in the aom crystal .
we have also studied the range of acoustic frequencies and drive power of the aom , for which the retro-reflected beam can be detected with adequate signal to noise .
to investigate the factors responsible for limited lichen recolonization on oak with declining so2 concentrations , parmelia caperata ( l. ) ach. and parmelia saxatilis ( l. ) ach. were transplanted to five stations along a transect running from central london ( u.k. ) into the surrounding countryside .
healthy thalli were transplanted onto young and mature quercus robur l. ( pedunculate oak ) and betula pendula roth ( silver birch ) , and some were moved with their original bark attached to investigate the importance of bark acidification .
relative growth rates and visible injury were monitored over 2 years , along with concentrations of atmospheric so2 and no2 , measured using diffusion tube samplers and bark chemistry .
so2 concentrations were low in central london in comparison with the situation in previous decades , but they remain sufficiently high to harm the most sensitive lichens .
no2 concentrations increased sharply on approaching london , and levels were higher in winter than in summer .
bark ph was lower in mature oak than in birch or young oak at the two innermost stations , and levels of bark mg also declined in london .
transplants of p. caperata survived on birch and young oak at all transect stations except hyde park , whereas p. saxatilis failed to grow over a wider range of the transect stations .
we conclude that modest so2 levels , interacting with low bark ph , still inhibit recolonization of oaks by p. caperata in central london .
parmelia saxatilis , in addition , appears to be limited by another factor such as the high no2 concentrations that now characterize urban and suburban london , rather than through an inherently poor dispersal potential .
the call rate of repetitive alarm calls produced by richardson &apos;s ground squirrels ( spermophilus richardsonii ) conveys the extent of threat during predator encounters .
it remains unknown , however , whether changes in call rate communicate predator movements .
that is , does an increasing call rate indicate an approaching predator and a decreasing rate the opposite ?
we presented free-living squirrels with moving predator models and recorded their responses .
vigilant behavior increased more when predators approached versus retreated , suggesting that squirrels recognize the changes in threat associated with predator movements .
squirrels rarely produced alarm calls during these encounters , however , suggesting that squirrels do not rely entirely on alarm vocalizations to assess the threat posed by potential predators .
receivers of manipulated calls did not respond differentially to alarm calls containing an increasing or decreasing rate of syllable production .
thus , while rate may encode information about the extent of threat , richardson &apos;s ground squirrels do not communicate predator movements via changes in call rate .
plants are frequently exposed to environmental stress and organisms that seek to benefit from their autotrophic nature .
to cope with these challenges plants have developed stress-resistance mechanisms , which involve sensing , activation of signal transduction cascades , changes in gene expression , and physiological adjustment .
exposure to one kind of stress often leads to cross-tolerance , that is , resistance to different kinds of stresses .
the search for a common underlying mechanism concentrates mostly on changes in cellular physiology and gene expression .
we focus on the cross-protective measures that are taken at the level above the single cell .
we argue that the controlled alterations in symplasmic permeability that underlie development also play a role in survival and defense strategies .
we propose that the closing of symplasmic paths constitutes an unspecific but effective early measure in adaptation and defense , which is accompanied by specific strategies tailored to the various challenges plants face .
microsatellites or simple sequence repeats ( ssrs ) are highly polymorphic , codominant markers that have great value for the construction of genetic maps , comparative mapping , population genetic surveys , and paternity analyses .
heer , we report the development and testing of a set of ssr markers derived from shotgun sequencing from populus trichocarpa torr. &amp; a. gray , a nonenriched genomic dna library , and bacterial artificial chromosomes .
approximately 23 % of the 1536 genomic clones and 48 % of the 768 bacterial artificial chromosome subclones contained an ssr .
ssr markers developed from p. trichocarpa showed high utility throughout the genus , with amplification rates in excess of 70 % for all populus species tested .
finally , at least 30 % of the markers amplified in several willow species , suggesting that some of these ssrs will be transferable across genera .
this action was also observed in cells in which calcium reserves were emptied using thapsigargin ( tg ) .
adenosine trisphosphate ( atp ) , a partial agonist and a physiological activator of purinergic receptors , also stimulated ca2+ entry independently of the calcium release from internal compartments .
the effects of 4ap and atp were not additive when studied on the same population of cells .
kn-62 inhibited an increase in calcium entry induced by 4ap , while brilliant blue g ( bbg ) prevented it , supporting the hypothesis that purinergic p2x7 receptors are involved in this action .
furthermore , 4ap allowed entry of ethidium bromide ( 314 da ) but not propidium iodide ( 415 da ) into the cell , also corroborating the involvement of p2x7 pores .
the presented results demonstrate , for the first time in human mononuclear cells isolated from healthy volunteers , that the p2x7 channel pore is involved in the action of 4ap and intervenes in the sustained calcium entry induced in response to 4ap .
the phylogenetic usefulness of the eggshell data , consisting of discrete characters , is assessed using eggshell characters alone and by adding the eggshell characters to a data matrix from the literature based on skeletal characters .
the resultant tree from the eggshell data alone yields apteryx as the most basal ratite , dinornithids as the sister taxon of a clade of large living ratites , with casuarius and dromaius in a sister-group relationship .
the combined eggshell and skeletal analysis revealed most groupings within ratitae that were based on previous cladistic analysis of the skeletal characters alone , but also supports two equally parsimonious topologies : one identifies dinornithidae and apteryx as a clade at the base of ratitae , and the other identifies apteryx as the sister taxon of a clade consisting of all the other ratites .
it is determined that the characteristics used to define the improperly named &quot; ratite morphotype &quot; in the current eggshell parataxonomy are not synapomorphies of the eggshell of ratitae .
an expanded cladistic analysis of the eggshells of avian and non-avian theropods is required to determine the phylogenetic usefulness of the characteristics of the ratite morphotype .
two experiments were set up to evaluate whether the response of atlantic cod ( gadus morhua ) larvae to no-prey conditions changes with age .
larval age also influences patterns of gut fullness over time , with the fastest rates of gut clearance found at first-feeding and metamorphosis .
solanum stramonifolium dunal .
( solanaceae ) is a pioneer species very common in the atlantic forest of northeast brazil .
the plants bear extrafloral nectaries ( efns ) that are frequently visited by ants .
ant exclusion experiments show reduced seed set in plants without ants .
this paper describes the morphology and anatomy of the nectary of s. stramonifolium .
this species bears structural efns , vascularized by both phloem and xylem .
the nectary is located around the lower , external surface of the calyx , as a ring of five protuberances .
secretory cells are present only below these protuberances and arranged in several strata .
the nectar is secreted by stomata situated on projections above the surface of these protuberances .
nectar secretion begins at the floral bud stage and continues through fruit development .
we suggest that production of nectar during the entire reproductive period of s. stramonifolium functions as a mechanism of flower and seed protection .
seasonal energy metabolism was investigated in young ( 2- to 3-year-old ) muskoxen ( ovibos moschatus ) during the winters of 1994 ( january-april ) and 1996 ( january ) and summer of 1995 ( july and august ) .
energy expenditure ( ee ) increased 35%-42 % following a meal of chopped brome hay ( bromus inermis ) and declined as a double-exponential process over 8 h. the mean energy cost of eating ( 321 and 361 j·g dry matter-1 ) was lower in winter than in summer , and declined with body mass ( bm ) ( r2 = 0.58 ) .
the mean energy cost of standing was 21 % ( se = 2.7 % ) higher than that of bedding .
prefeeding energy expenditure ( eep ) was 26 % higher in summer than in winter .
seasonal eep , postfeeding ee , and rq are consistent with a low cost of maintenance metabolism in winter and an increased requirement for productivity in summer .
many anesthetics are known to decrease ventilation ( vdote ) and metabolic rate ( mr ) .
because mr is known to contribute to the vdote level , one would expect some parallelism between the changes in vdote and mr during anesthesia .
we tested this hypothesis in normoxia and hypoxia ( 12 % o2 ) on male wistar rats ( n = 10 ; 221288 g) by using a short-acting intravenous anesthetic , propofol .
propofol anesthesia was induced with a 77.5 mg kg1 ( 6070 s) dose and maintained with a 2022 mg kg1 h1 ( &lt;40 min ) dose .
in normoxia , propofol significantly decreased vdote and mr and maintained the vdote/mr ratio .
in hypoxia , propofol decreased mr without a significant decrease in vdote , and the vdote/mr ratio tended to increase .
as a result , both in normoxia and hypoxia , propofol did not significantly increase the partial pressure of co2 in arterial blood ( paco2 ) .
propofol was also associated with decreased body temperature and mean arterial pressure .
the results suggest that during anesthesia , a large part of the drop in vdote can be accounted for by the drop in mr , and that in both normoxia and hypoxia the vdote/mr ratios and paco2values are maintained close to the levels of the conscious state .
we studied broadleaf and needle-leaf forests along an elevation gradient ( 6001200 m) at whiteface mountain , new york , to determine relationships among temperature , mineral n availability , and aboveground net primary productivity ( anpp ) and controls on the latter two variables .
we measured net n mineralization during the growing season , annual litterfall quantity and quality , aboveground woody biomass accumulation , and soil organic matter quality .
across this climosequence , air temperature ( as growing season degree-days ) exerted the most control on anpp .
nitrogen mineralization was most strongly related to soil growing season degree-days and less so to lignin to n ratios in litter .
anpp was correlated with n mineralization but not with mineral n availability .
combining our data with those from similar studies in other boreal and cool temperate forests shows that n mineralization and anpp are correlated at local , regional , and interbiome scales .
regarding the persistent question concerning cause and effect in the n mineralization  forest productivity relationship , our data provide evidence that at least in this case , forest productivity is a control on n mineralization .
intercalary meristems are responsible for the production of the majority of cells in stems .
the overall objective of the present study was to determine (i) the boundaries of the proliferative parenchyma cells in the intercalary meristems and ( ii ) the proliferative capacity of cells in the intercalary meristems in stems of a species of bambusa schreb. ( bamboo ) , phragmites australis ( cav . )
trin. ex steud. , triticum aestivum l. , and zea mays l. data show that lengths of parenchyma cells within proliferative portions of intercalary meristems were not the same for all intercalary meristems of a species .
lengths of elongated parenchyma cells in internodes were relatively similar among internodes of a species , but lengths of elongated parenchyma cells in internodes were not similar among the four grass species tested .
for example , cell lengths of elongated parenchyma cells in internodes of p. australis ranged from 14.8 to 23.0 µm , very different from lengths of elongated cells in bambusa sp. ( 69.175.4 µm ) .
the number of proliferative cells in most files of intercalary meristems of bambusa was less than 15 .
for many of the intercalary meristems of p. australis , the intercalary meristem consisted of 1025 cells in each file .
fourth intercalary meristems of t. aestivum and z. mays consisted of 20 and 25 cells in files , respectively .
data showed that none of the cell populations of the intercalary meristems of four species exhibited an exponential cell length distribution .
in general , less than half of the 10 groups of cells had percentages of cells that resembled an exponential cell-age distribution .
these data lead to the conclusion that not all parenchyma cells of intercalary meristems are rapidly proliferating .
also , potentially prolifera tive cells ( short cells ) of the intercalary meristems may not be localized into a specific zone but are more scattered throughout the nodal region .
ceratochloa of south america .
plant materials included 28 hexaploid ( 2n = 6x = 42 ) and 2 octoploid ( 2n = 8x = 56 ) accessions .
based on multivariate analyses of 24 characters , the two octoploid accessions formed an isolated , well-defined group , while the hexaploids formed two less-defined groups .
characterized by lemma awns longer than 3 mm , one group consisted of those accessions of b. coloratus , b. lithobius , and b. stamineus , whereas the other group consisted of b. catharticus , b. mango , and b. tunicatus .
a significant mantel test statistic ( r = 0.70 , p = 0.001 ) suggested a high correlation between morphological variation and dna polymorphism .
taken together , our results indicated that the hexaploid complex should be described as a single variable species ( b. cathar ticus ) , with two nearly continuous groups : b. catharticus subsp. catharticus ( vahl ) herter and b. catharticus subsp. stamineus ( e. desv . )
massa .
based on nomenclature priority and type specimen designations , the octoploid accessions should be described as bromus coloratus .
the early formation of precipitation and enhanced scavenging contributed to a registration of approximately 2.5 times the concentration of sulfate in the precipitation near the surface than in the air found at this level .
the spring case numerical experiment on 3 april 2000 with a chemical background taken from macedonia , provided insight into the potential influence of the long-range transport of atmospheric pollutants and ascertained quantitativequalitative information about processes by which acidic species are incorporated into precipitation .
the model-computed parameters are in good agreement with observation .
the average equivalent cloud water ph and rainwater ph when the higher acid precipitation occurs are about 5.0 and 4.5 , respectively .
the results from a number of sensitivity tests of cloud chemistry of the physical processes for the continental nonpolluted and continental polluted environments , indicate that nucleation and impact scavenging of aerosols account for between 20%24 % of the total sulfur mass removed by wet deposition .
liquid-phase oxidation contributes about 20%28 % of the sulfur content in precipitation .
it means that neglecting liquid-phase oxidation when considering the chemistry in these clouds may lead to underestimates of about 20%28 % in sulfate wet deposition .
neglect of the ice phase when considering the chemistry in continental nonpolluted and continental polluted clouds may lead to overestimates of about 112%130 % of the total sulfur mass removed by wet deposition .
the assumption of henry &apos;s law equilibrium for those types of clouds gives an overestimation of about 100%120 % , respectively .
we synthesize current information on input , accumulation , and decay of coarse woody debris ( cwd ) compared with other aboveground litter to assess the role of cwd in the nutrient cycles of northern coniferous forests .
nitrogen or p concentrations in cwd increase during decay , depending on the initial n/p ratio , which eventually converges at about 20 .
cwd is initially a sink for n and ( or ) p , whichever is least available , but becomes a source later in decay .
cwd contributes &lt;5 % of the n released annually .
there is little evidence that cwd retains significant amounts of excess n following disturbance .
we conclude that cwd is of minor importance in the nutrient cycles of northern coniferous forests , and that guidelines for cwd retention should be based on other perceived benefits of cwd .
slightly alkaline hot springs and geysers in yellowstone national park exhibit distinctive assemblages of high-temperature ( &gt;73 °c ) siliceous sinter reflecting local hydrodynamic conditions .
the main depositional zones include subaqueous pool and channel bottoms and intermittently wetted subaerial splash , surge , and overflow areas .
subaqueous deposits include particulate siliceous sediment and dendritic and microbial silica framework .
silica framework forms thin , porous , microbe-rich films coating subaqueous surfaces .
spicules with intervening narrow crevices dominate in splash zones .
surge and overflow deposits include pool and channel rims , columns , and knobs .
in thin section , subaerial sinter is composed of (i) dark brown , nearly opaque laminated sinter deposited on surfaces that evaporate to dryness ; ( ii ) clear translucent silica deposited subaqueously through precipitation driven by supersaturation ; ( iii ) heterogeneous silica representing silica-encrusted microbial filaments and detritus ; and ( iv ) sinter debris .
brownish laminations form the framework of most sinter deposited in surge and overflow zones .
pits and cavities are common architectural features of subaerial sinter and show concave-upward pseudo-cross-laminations and micro-unconformities developed through migration .
marked birefringence of silica deposited on surfaces that evaporate to dryness is probably a strain effect .
repeated wetting and evaporation , often to dryness , and capillary effects control the deposition , morphology , and microstructure of most high-temperature sinter outside of the fully subaqueous zone .
microbial filaments are abundant on and within high-temperature sinter but do not provide the main controls on morphology or structuring except in biofilms developed on subaqueous surfaces .
millimetre-scale lamination cyclicity in much high-temperature sinter represents annual layering and regular seasonal fluctuations in silica sedimentation .
bacteria were isolated from a cultivated soil and screened for antagonistic activity against fusarium graminearum , a predominant agent of ear rot and head blight in cereal crops .
based on its in vitro effectiveness , isolate d1/2 was selected for characterization and identified as a strain of bacillus subtilis by phenotypic tests and comparative analysis of its 16s ribosomal rna gene ( rdna ) sequence .
it inhibited the mycelial growth of a collection of common fungal phytopathogens , including eight fusarium species , three other ascomycetes , and one basidiomycete .
the cell-free culture filtrate of d1/2 at different dilutions was active against macroconidium germination and hyphal growth of f. graminearum , depending on the initial macroconidium density .
it induced the formation of swollen hyphal cells in liquid cultures of this fungus grown from macroconidia .
a bioassay also demonstrated that d1/2 offered in planta protection against the damping-off disease in alfalfa seedlings caused by f. graminearum , while the type strain of b. subtilis was ineffective .
hence , b. subtilis d1/2 or its culture filtrate has potential application in controlling plant diseases caused by fusarium .
parthenogenesis induced by cytoplasmatically inherited wolbachia bacteria has been found in a number of arthropod species , mainly hymenoptera .
previously , two different forms of diploidy restoration have been reported to underlie parthenogenesis induction in hymenoptera by wolbachia .
both are a form of gamete duplication , but each differs in their timing .
we investigated the cytology of the early embryonic development of a wolbachia-infected strain of the parasitoid wasp leptopilina clavipes and compared it with that of an uninfected sexual strain .
both strains have a similar meiosis .
in the infected parthenogenetic strain , diploidy is restored by anaphase restitution during the first somatic mitosis , similar to trichogramma , but not to muscidifurax .
our results confirm the occurrence of different cytological mechanisms of diploidy restoration associated with parthenogenesis-inducing wolbachia in the order hymenoptera .
fire directly releases carbon (c) to the atmosphere through combustion of biomass .
an estimated 1470 ± 59 km2 of peatland burns annually in boreal , western canada , releasing 4.7 ± 0.6 tg c to the atmosphere via direct combustion .
we quantified within-site variation in organic matter lost via combustion in a bog peatland in association with the 116 000-ha chisholm , alberta , fire in 2001 .
we found that hollows exhibit more combustion than hummocks , releasing nearly twice as much c to the atmosphere .
runoff as overland flow and interflow from hillslopes on the boreal plain ecozone of north america is likely to depend on near-surface hydraulic properties .
hydraulic properties were examined in orthic gray luvisolic soil profiles in alberta , canada , over several years following clear-cut winter logging and contrasted to those in adjacent forested areas .
infiltration characteristics were determined with double ring infiltrometers at both logged and forested sites .
saturated hydraulic conductivity ( ksat ) of ae and bt horizons was measured in logged areas with undisturbed uhland core samples .
infiltration parameters derived by the kostiakov equation suggest that initial infiltration rates are higher at forested sites than logged .
steady-state infiltration was greater under forest .
vertical ksat of the ae was less than the bt horizon , and horizontal ksat of the ae horizon exceeded vertical , indicating anisotropy .
compaction and soil swelling resulting from increased soil water content after logging probably reduced macro-porosity and lowered infiltration capacity .
similarity of ksat between ae and bt horizons in logged areas may have reflected compaction .
logging then may temporarily increase the potential for overland flow but may reduce interflow through ae horizons until time restores soil hydraulic characteristics to that of an older forest .
the enterprise resource planning ( erp ) system can integrate the major business management functions of the enterprise with a single common database to allow sharing of all information and achieve efficient communications between management functions .
based on the needs of running a construction enterprise , erp shows potential applicability to the construction industry .
this paper sought to quantify the benefits of erp systems when applied to construction materials procurement .
specifically , this paper briefly described the business processes involved in construction materials procurement and illustrated how erp systems could be implemented and the efficiency of the construction materials management system consequently enhanced .
the transformation from a non-erp system into an erp system through application integration , internal integration , external integration , and automation were simulated .
results show that the individual task improvements of models can increase the productivity of the materials management cycle by up to 5.2 % , 18.2 % , 27.8 % , 13.5 % , and 79.2 % through internal integration , external integration , application integration , automation , and erp system , respectively , by automating most of the repeated transactions and reducing manpower required to perform the tasks .
stream temperature impacts resulting from forest harvesting in riparian areas have been documented in a number of locations in north america .
as part of the stuarttakla fisheriesforestry interaction project , we have investigated the influence of three variable-retention riparian harvesting prescriptions on temperatures in first-order streams in the interior sub-boreal forests of northern british columbia .
prescriptions were designed to represent a range of possible harvesting options outlined by the forest practices code of b.c. , or associated best management practice guidelines .
five years after the completion of harvesting treatments , temperatures remained four to six degrees warmer , and diurnal temperature variation remained higher than in the control streams regardless of treatment .
initially , the high-retention treatment acted to mitigate the temperature effects of the harvesting , but 3 successive years of windthrow was antecedent to reduced canopy density and equivalent temperature impacts .
we speculate that late autumn reversals in the impacts of forest harvesting also occur .
temperature impacts in this study remained within the tolerance limits of local biota .
however , even modest temperature changes could alter insect production , egg incubation , fish rearing , migration timing , and susceptibility to disease , and the effects of large changes to daily temperature range are not well understood .
results of stratigraphic , upb geochronological , and geochemical study are reported for rocks in a 2800 km2 area along the southeastern margin of the archean rae province on north-central baffin island .
archean rocks include a gneiss complex , two greenstone belts of the mary river group , and various younger plutonic rocks .
the 30002800 ma gneiss complex contains intrusions of orthogneiss , dated at 27802770 ma. intermediate-felsic volcanism in overlying greenstone belts occurred at 27402725 ma and was accompanied and outlasted by calc-alkaline plutonism ( 27302715 ma ) .
peraluminous plutonism at ca. 2700 ma , possibly associated with low- to medium-pressure metamorphism , represents the culmination of the archean tectonic cycle .
dating of metamorphic zircon and titanite in archean gneissic rocks indicates that overprinting , high-grade metamorphism in the northwest part of the area ( footwall of the isortoq fault zone ) is paleoproterozoic ( ca. 1820 ma ) .
a weaker , somewhat older thermal disturbance ( ca. 18501840 ma with large errors ) is recorded in the hanging wall of this zone .
additional tectonothermal events at ca. 15001400 ma and ca. 700 ma may , respectively , correlate with mesoproterozoic faulting and emplacement of the franklin dyke swarm .
unlike their age-correlative counterparts in the mary river area and on the mainland to the southwest , the greenstone belts at eqe bay lack abundant orthoquartzite and komatiitic volcanic rocks : calc-alkaline volcanic rocks predominate , suggesting a fundamentally different tectonic environment .
striking similarities , both in lithology and age , to greenstone belts of the minto block of the superior province raises the question of raesuperior correlation .
previously described weed competition models that use competition indices based on weed size relative to tree size ( e.g. , tree height divided by weed height ) require models of weed growth and models of weed-free tree growth .
a method is presented to model these using standard sigmoidal growth functions and to incorporate regular seasonal patterns of tree growth using fourier series approximations .
the method is tested against data from a field trial at rotorua , new zealand , in which pinus radiata d. don was grown both on its own and in competition with several common weed species .
weed and tree height were best modeled by a weibull function , and tree ground line diameter by a schumacher function .
seasonal fluctuations in both tree and weed growth were adequately modeled by a single-term fourier series .
all weed species showed very similar , strong seasonal fluctuations in height growth , peaking in february .
seasonal fluctuations in tree height growth , and especially diameter growth , were less marked and peaked earlier , in december .
simulations suggested that it is necessary to account for seasonal effects when modeling competition during the first year of growth , but that seasonal effects have less influence in subsequent years .
the twelve azabenzenes  the species formed by replacing ch groups of benzene by n  were examined computationally ( with emphasis on the six contiguous-nitrogen species ) .
mp2(fc)/6-31g* , b3lyp/6-31g* , ccsd(t)/6-31g*//mp2(fc)/6-31g* , and g3(mp2) calculations were used to probe kinetic and thermodynamic stabilities , homodesmotic ring-opening energies , electron distribution ( bond orders and lengths , bird index ) , and nics values , primarily to discern where the transition occurs from reasonably stable to highly fragile species .
some azabenzenes with three and those with four or more nitrogens are thermodynamically unstable , but kinetic stabilities indicated that , with the possible exception of hexaazabenzene , all the azabenzenes should be isolable , although some with four nitrogens might decompose at room temperature , and pentaazabenzene would require matrix isolation techniques .
this study examines the short-term impact of forest soil compaction and organic matter removal on soil mesofauna , in general , and oribatid mite species , in particular .
both soil compaction and organic matter removal reduced the density of soil mesofauna .
stem-only harvesting reduced total mesofauna densities by 20 % relative to uncut forest values .
a combination of whole-tree harvest and forest floor removal with heavy soil compaction significantly reduced total soil mesofauna densities by 93 % relative to the uncut forest control .
removal of the forest floor represents a substantial loss of habitat for most soil mesofauna .
the forest floor apparently buffered the mineral soil by limiting both the impact of soil compaction and fluctuations in soil temperature and moisture .
the relative abundance of prostigmata and mesostigmata increased with treatment severity , whereas that of oribatida decreased .
species richness of the oribatid mite fauna was reduced as the severity of treatments increased .
the number of rare oribatid species ( those representing &lt;1 % of the total oribatid mite sample ) decreased by 40 % or more relative to the uncut forest control .
evenness also decreased as treatment severity increased .
oppiella nova and suctobelbella sp. near acutidens were the dominant oribatid species in both the forest floor and mineral soil , regardless of treatment .
soil compaction and organic matter removal significantly impacted the density and diversity of soil mesofauna and oribatid mite fauna in the short term at these study sites .
partial production cross sections of electromagnetic breakup of 32s projectiles at two widely differing energies were measured using an emulsion target .
the electromagnetic dissociation represents about 6 % and 17 % of the total number of nuclear events at elab/a = 3.7 and 200 gev , respectively .
the experimental electromagnetic cross sections ïemdexp show an energy dependence that is well reproduced by the weizsackerwilliams approximation .
the value of ïemdexp at 200a gev ( with î³ &gt;&gt; 1) shows a good agreement with that predicted by the combined model of pshenichnov et al. examination of the reactions ( î³ , p) and ( î³ , he ) reveals that the ratio of 1 p/1 he cross sections is close to unity at dubna energy ( 3.7a gev ) , while it rapidly increases to 3.0 ± 0.6 at cern energy ( 200a gev ) .
in most of the observed dissociation modes , the total kinetic energy of the fragments in the projectile rest frame is lower than 50 mev .
nevertheless , it is possible that the contribution of excitation modes of the different multipolarities is determining in this region .
much research attention regarding climate change has been focused on the macrophysical and , to a lesser extent , the macrosocial features of this phenomenon .
combining the insights of economics and sociology , we provide an ideal-type model of northern forest-based communities that suggests that these communities may represent a particularized social context in regard to climate change .
although scientific research indicates that northern forest ecosystems are among those regions at greatest risk to the impacts of climate change , the social dimensions of these communities indicate both a limited community capacity and a limited potential to perceive climate change as a salient risk issue that warrants action .
well-characterized templates of polymer-forming ligands and their ruthenium tris(î±,î±â²-diimine) initiators were utilized to divergently ring open an îµ-caprolactone monomer .
the same polymers were also obtained through the synthesis of quinoline and bipyridine diimine ligands incorporating poly(îµ-caprolactone) ( pcl ) chains .
these polymers contain vacant molecular recognition sites , enabling subsequent chelation of these macroligands to metal precursors .
both methods provided telechelic ( îµ-caprolactone ) ruthenium(ii)-centered polyesters of various hierarchy .
solution properties and thermal behavior of such polyesters are described .
although headwater streams constitute a significant portion of stream length within watersheds , their aquatic fauna , contributions to regional biodiversity , and responses to forest management have been understudied .
ma cro in ver te brate communities , physical habitat , and water chemistry were sampled from 40 headwater streams in managed forests in the oregon coast range mountains .
we characterized functional and structural attributes of ma cro in ver te brate communities in relation to physical , chemical , and biological gradients .
substrate composition , specific conductance , and riparian forest age showed the strongest correlations with resultant ordination patterns in ma cro in ver te brate community composition .
among individual metrics of community structure and composition , total ma cro in ver te brate density and dominance by three taxa showed the strongest correlations with forest age .
no community measures were related to densities of torrent salamanders ( rhyacotriton kezeri ) or crayfish ( pacifastacus leniusculus ) , suggesting these potential predators had little influence on overall ma cro in ver te brate community structure .
rare taxa were sampled from several reaches , including rhyacophila probably viquaea for which little information is available , and an eobrachycentrus sp. , previously known to occur only in the cascade mountains .
headwater streams within these managed forests of northwestern oregon appear to be taxa rich , continue to support taxa limited to headwater streams , and harbor taxa about which little is known .
inheritance of resistance in wheat appears to be quantitative .
to date , breeding of partially resistant cultivars has been the only effective way to combat this pathogen .
the partial resistance components , namely length of incubation period , disease severity , and length of latent period , were evaluated on a population of doubled haploids derived from a cross between the partially resistant triticum aestivum &apos; liwilla &apos; and susceptible triticum aestivum &apos; begra &apos; .
experiments were conducted in a controlled environment and the fifth leaf was examined .
for qtls were significantly associated with partial resistance components and were located on chromosomes 2b , 3b , 5b , and 5d .
the percentage of phenotypic variance explained by a single qtl ranged from 14 to 21 % for incubation period , from 16 to 37 % for disease severity , and from 13 to 28 % for latent period .
contrast degradation theory predicts that increased turbidity decreases the visibility of objects that are visible at longer distances more than that of objects that are visible at short distances .
consequently , turbidity should disproportionately decrease feeding rates by piscivorous fish , which feed on larger and more visible prey than particle-feeding planktivorous fish .
we tested this prediction in a series of laboratory feeding experiments , the results of which indicated that prey consumption by two species of planktivorous fish ( juvenile chum salmon ( oncorhynchus keta ) and walleye pollock ( theragra chalcogramma ) ) is much less sensitive to elevated turbidity than piscivorous feeding by sablefish ( anoplopoma fimbria ) .
planktivorous feeding in the turbidity range tested ( 0â40 nephelometric turbidity units ( ntu ) ) was reduced at high light intensity , but not at low light intensity .
comparatively low ( 5â10 ntu ) turbidity decreased both the rate at which sablefish pursued prey and the probability of successful prey capture .
these results suggest that turbid environments may be advantageous for planktivorous fish because they will be less vulnerable to predation by piscivores , but will not experience a substantial decrease in their ability to capture zooplankton prey .
pink salmon ( oncorhynchus gorbuscha ) are generally considered weak upriver migrants relative to sockeye salmon ( oncorhynchus nerka ) , though this assertion is largely anecdotal .
to assess energy-use patterns during migration , we collected pink salmon from two major fraser river stocks ( weaver and seton in british columbia , canada ) in 1999 at three times and locations : (1) at the start of freshwater migration , (2) at the end of migration before spawning , and (3) immediately after spawning .
we calculated the energy content of somatic and reproductive tissues , recorded several body measurements , and conducted both intraspecific ( between pink stocks ) and interspecific analyses with co-migrating fraser river sockeye salmon collected during the same season .
we found that between pink salmon stocks , there were no significant energetic or morphological differences either at river entry or upon arrival at spawning areas regardless of the level of migratory difficulty encountered .
when compared with sockeye salmon , however , we found that pink salmon began upriver migration with significantly smaller somatic energy reserves but made up for this deficiency by minimizing absolute transport and activity costs , presumably by seeking out migratory paths of least resistance .
this energetic efficiency comes at a cost to reproductive output : relative to sockeye salmon , pink salmon diverted less absolute energy to egg production , producing smaller ovaries and fewer eggs .
we speculate that fundamental differences in behavior shape the migratory energetic tactics employed by pink salmon .
les conséquences directes des crues sont souvent considérées comme limitées à la zone d&apos;inondation maximale engendrée en aval .
or , vu l&apos;ordre de grandeur des débits de crues exceptionnelles , le lit fluvial pourrait subir de profonds bouleversements .
la méthode est directement applicable à la délimitation de la zone d&apos;évacuation à envisager en cas de rupture de barrage .
carnivores living in areas of deep snow face additional energy expenditures during winter owing to increased locomotory costs .
such costs may vary in function of snow depth and hardness ( sinking depth of animal ) and travel speed .
we estimated energetic costs of locomotion through snow in wild coyotes ( canis latrans ) using three coyote-sized domestic dogs ( canis familiaris ) to develop regression models predicting heart rate ( as surrogate for energy expenditure ) in relation to sinking depth and travel speed .
in the absence of snow , heart rates of dogs increased linearly with travel speed ( r2 = 0.24 ) , whereas when snow was present , track sinking depth affected heart rate substantially more than did travel speed .
to assess whether our results with domestic dogs could help explain the behavior of wild coyotes , we snow-tracked coyotes in southeastern quebec , canada , during two winters .
during a normal harsh winter , coyotes relied on artificially packed snow ( snowmobile and animal trails ) more than during a mild winter .
coyotes typically exerted a fine-scale selection for snow depth and hardness that effectively reduced their sinking depth by ~2 cm. we estimated that traveling over snow increased coyote heart rate by 4%â6 % in comparison with locomotion on hard surfaces , whereas fine-scale selection saved a similar amount of extra energy .
we hypothesize that the use of snow packed by anthropogenic activities , especially snowmobile trails , may not only facilitate coyote movements in deep snow environments but also allow occupation of marginal habitats such as forested areas of northeastern north america .
the marmara region is an active tectonic zone characterized by a transition in the dextral strike-slip regime of the western part of the north anatolian fault zone .
the main goal of this paper is to assess the use of global positioning system ( gps ) data sets collected during five relatively short time intervals during the period december 2000  march 2002 to detect potential crustal deformations .
to determine if the deformations measured with gps are real or only a data artifact , a statistical reliability analysis of the solutions is performed .
the results indicate that each station has statistically different temporal behavior and significant relative motions .
this area is consequently still very active , with significant deformation patterns .
although the average magnitude for our estimated displacement rates with respect to ankr station , which represents the rigid motion of the anatolian plate , is in the order of 1.1 cm/year in the south of the north anatolian fault , it increases to 2.3 cm/year in the northern part of the area .
autographa californica nucleopolyhedrosisvirus ( acmnpv ) is the type member of the family baculoviridae .
gene expression of acmnpv during virus infection is temporally regulated .
a series of late expression factors ( lefs ) are required for late gene expression to take place .
a number of additional factors have also been shown to more modestly influence late gene expression .
using the lef transient assay , we scanned the acmnpv genome for such factors by replacing plasmids using the lef genes with larger clones and then looked for increases in late gene expression using a reporter plasmid under the control of a late promoter .
using this approach , orf98 was identified as having a stimulatory effect on late gene expression .
the ability of orf98 to influence early , late , and very late gene expression was established .
furthermore , tagged versions of orf98 were localized to the nuclei of transfected cells and were shown to interact with each other as homo-oligomers .
potential roles of orf98 in baculovirus infection are discussed .
postspawners migrated downstream after reproduction or overwintered in the river .
environmental differences related to geographical location may be responsible for the variation of migration patterns and other life-history traits observed among brook charr populations , emphasizing the co-evolution of anadromy and life history .
we purified the nitrate reductase from the soluble fraction of magnetospirillum magnetotacticum ms-1 .
the enzyme was composed of 86- and 17-kda subunits and contained molybdenum , non-heme iron , and heme c. these properties are very similar to those of the periplasmic nitrate reductase found in paracoccus pantotrophus .
the m. magnetotacticum nap locus was clustered in seven open reading frames , napfdaghbc .
the phylogenetic analyses of napa , napb , and napc suggested a close relationship between m. magnetotacticum nap genes and escherichia coli nap genes , which is not consistent with the 16s rdna data .
this is the first finding that the a subclass of proteobacteria possesses a napfdaghbc-type nap gene cluster .
the nap gene cluster had putative fumarate and nitrate reduction regulatory protein ( fnr ) and narl protein binding sites .
furthermore , we investigated the effect of molybdate deficiency in medium on the total iron content of the magnetosome fraction and discussed the physiological function of nitrate reductase in relation to the magnetite synthesis in m. magnetotacticum .
the flow of a viscous incompressible electrically conducting fluid due to the rotation of an insulated disk of finite radius is considered .
the motion is steady ; the disk having uniform angular speed about its axis , parallel to which a magnetic field is applied .
this paper presents relative sea-level curves from amund and ellef ringnes islands , northwest queen elizabeth islands .
these curves are of exponential form and record continuous , ongoing holocene emergence , although northwest ellef ringnes island is experiencing a late holocene transgression .
isobases drawn on postglacial shorelines rise southeastward towards an uplift center in norwegian bay .
these suggest the ringnes islands occupied the northwest radius of the innuitian uplift , which is congruent with glacial geological evidence suggesting parts of the ringnes islands were covered by the late wisconsinan innuitian ice sheet .
the isobases provide a provisional reconstruction of glacioisostatic recovery within the northwest innuitian uplift .
their pattern supports earlier reconstructions that maximum late wisconsinan ice thickness occurred across norwegian bay , marking the position of an ice divide , which is consistent with ice-flow features on amund ringnes island .
they record the diminishing thickness of the innuitian ice sheet from norwegian bay to the arctic ocean .
the absence of an isobase embayment across the ringnes islands suggests a relatively uniform ice load across both islands and hassel and massey sounds .
parallel isobases across peary channel indicate this ice load extended beyond massey sound , although their northward deflection suggests an increasing influence of the former axel heiberg island ice load .
physical , anatomical , chemical , and microbiological properties of wetwood in heartwood were compared with those of sapwood and normal heartwood in balsam fir ( abies balsamea ( l. ) mill. ) .
wetwood found only in heartwood of balsam fir had significantly higher moisture content ( mc ) than normal heartwood but not significantly higher mc than sapwood .
no differences in relative density or shrinkage properties were found among tissue types .
wetwood tissue needed longer times to dry to an equilibrium mc of 15 % , not only because of its high initial mc , but also because of its lower moisture permeability ( diffusion coefficient ) in this particular mc range ( from initial mc to 15 % equilibrium mc ) .
there was no correlation between either si or sg and adiponectin protein or mrna levels .
ppar-î³ mrna abundance remained constant , whereas leptin and resistin mrnas and plasma leptin declined and rxr-î± mrna abundance increased in both white and brown fat .
leptin mrna abundance was closely correlated with si ( r2 = 0.91 and 0.87 for white and brown fat , respectively ) .
resistin mrna abundance correlated inversely with sg ( r2 = 0.99 and 0.84 for white and brown fat , respectively ) .
these data indicate that changes in the expression of leptin are more closely correlated with the insulin resistance of fasting than with changes in other adipokines or rxr-î± and ppar-î³ expression .
georgie river area is underlain by greenschist facies volcanic , clastic , and plutonic rock .
high precision upb isotopic ages on zircon enable regional stratigraphic correlation by constraining the lower to lower middle jurassic depositional history .
a sample from pyroxene-phyric tholeiitic basalt is upper triassic and ( or ) lower jurassic in age ; its upper age limit is constrained by a crosscutting intrusion dated at 189.8 ± 0.3 ma. the bulldog creek pluton , at 193.0 ± 0.3 ma , is significantly older than the previously reported kar age .
hazelton group strata include a coarse-grained volcaniclastic and volcanic unit overlain by a fine-grained clastic and bimodal volcanic flow unit .
the coarse volaniclastic unit is coeval and probably cogenetic with the outram lake porphyry intrusion ( 189.7 ± 0.3 ma ) and near the top includes andesitic tuff ( 189.8 ± 0.6 ma ) .
these data constrain the age of deposition of the unit and support correlation with the lower jurassic hazelton group and members of the texas creek plutonic suite .
age of the fine clastic and bimodal volcanic unit is no older than the youngest detrital zircons ( ca. 185 ma ) near its base .
that age and the age of a rhyolite unit ( 176.6 ± 1.1 ma ) at the top support correlation with the middle jurassic salmon river formation of the hazelton group .
resolution of the litho- and chronostratigraphy of the area reveal close similarities in age , rock types , succession , and composition with strata that host the base- and precious metal-rich stratiform eskay creek deposit , revealing the potential for eskay-type volcanogenic massive sulfide ( vms ) deposits in the georgie river area .
ecophysiological and dendroecological data from a temperate sessile oak ( quercus petraea ( matt . )
liebl. ) stand in belgium were used to develop and parameterize a dendroecological process-based model .
the purpose of this model is to serve as a tool for exploring the relationship between climate variability and tree growth based on dendro ecological data .
when parameterized , the model was able to correctly simulate measurements of bud-burst date , through fall ( r2 = 0.95 ) , soil water content ( r2 = 0.81 ) , transpiration ( r2 = 0.80 ) , and ring-width series from 1960 to 1999 ( r2 = 0.46 ) .
model sensitivity analysis showed that atmospheric vapor pressure deficit is the major controlling factor of transpiration in this type of ecosystem .
the model shows that bole increment is principally controlled by temperature because it affects the phenological process of bud burst and thus the growing season length .
precipitation variability does not affect variation of transpiration rate and bole increment because calculated soil water stress is negligible during the simulation period .
discrepancies between observed and simulated bole increment may be a consequence of stand density variations and worm defoliation in the spring .
the maiden model is particularly suited for dendreocological analysis because it takes simple species , site condition , and climatic variables as input .
two sets of preference curves , one obtained from literature for the river pollon , france , and another for the river kuusinkijoki , finland , were tested .
all transferability tests for water velocity criteria were successful , correlation coefficients between local fish densities and preference indices ranging from 0.83 to 0.92 .
combined indices predicted fish microdistributions inconsistently and they never performed better than the best univariate index for each site .
our results suggest that universal preference criteria for water velocity may exist for larval grayling and that it may be best to use these criteria alone in habitat hydraulic modeling when predicting habitat suitability to larval grayling .
a preliminary investigation of factors affecting controlled struvite crystallization was conducted in bench-scale studies using a new crystallization reactor design , operating under a range of reactor and feed strength conditions .
in 21 different experiments , it was found that the bench-scale reactor functioned well in terms of achieving good particle classification , although its performance was somewhat restricted in terms of p removal .
reactor operation was generally somewhat compromised because of scale effects .
as a preliminary to further ( ongoing ) pilot-scale investigations , it was found that , for a given set of operating and feed strength conditions , there was a specific value of ph ( phlim ) beyond which the reactor would not operate effectively .
the ph value is an important operating parameter in struvite crystallization , and the mode of ph operation plays a major role in determining struvite crystal quality .
when operated at ph values exceeding phlim , poor quality ( i.e. , dendritic ) crystals were produced and reactor plugging often occurred .
a qualitative assessment of temperature effects on crystallization reactions suggested that low temperatures may indeed favor struvite crystal growth .
reactor seeding was not found to be a factor of any particular importance since , once struvite crystallization reactions were underway , the reactor appeared to be &quot; self-seeding &quot; .
the electrocatalytic hydrogenation ( ech ) of phenol was carried out in aqueous media with catalytic powders .
the catalytic powders were composed of palladium nanoaggregates deposited on various substrates such as al2o3 , baso4 , and baco3 .
composite powders are trapped ( upon stirring ) into a reticulated vitreous carbon ( rvc ) matrix , allowing a rapid in situ build-up of the electrode and alleviating the use of a binder , since the latter may have a detrimental effect on the ech .
for a given amount of noble metal ( 5 % palladium by weight ) , it is observed that the ech of phenol to cyclohexanol increases in the following order : pd/baco3 &lt; pd/baso4 &lt; pd/al2o3 .
it is deduced that the ech rate is largely dependent on the adsorption of organic molecules on the nonmetallic substrate , and a model is considered to explain such a behavior .
the ech of phenol is also feasible at a reasonable rate with composite pd/al2o3 ( 0.25 % pd by weight ) powders fabricated by physical vapor deposition because the peripheral distribution of pd nanoaggregates is favorable towards the ech .
this parameter set was then validated on a wet weather sampling campaign .
once the confidence in the simulations &apos; results was established , several wet-weather scenarios were simulated , with maximum flow and variable pollutant loading .
they show that the higher cod load discharge is due to a hydraulic flush of soluble inert compounds , and how the biological potential can be used to treat almost any realistically possible carbon and nitrogen overload .
the different performances of silica fume blended mortars placed in various sulfate-bearing exposure conditions were investigated .
experimental study was carried out on mortars immersed in 5 % sodium sulfate , 5 % magnesium sulfate , and mixed 5 % sodium sulfate and 5 % magnesium sulfate solutions for 270 d of sulfate exposure .
another variable was the replacement ratio of cement with silica fume ( 0 , 5 , 10 , and 15 % of the cement by weight ) .
the results showed conclusively that silica fume should be given serious consideration for use in sulfate environments .
in other words , in a sodium sulfate solution , silica fume showed a beneficial effect on mitigating compressive strength reduction and length change of mortars .
these different sulfate deterioration mechanisms are presented in the study .
schistosomes infect over 200 million people and 600 million are at risk .
genomics and post-genomic studies of schistosomes will contribute greatly to developing new reagents for diagnostic purposes and new vaccines that are of interest to the biotechnology industry .
in this review , the most recent advances in these fields as well as new projects and future perspectives will de described .
a vast quantity of data is publicly available , including short cdna and genomic sequences , complete large genomic fragments , and the mitochondrial genomes of three species of the genus schistosoma .
the physical structure of the genome is being studied by physically mapping large genomic fragments and characterizing the highly abundant repetitive dna elements .
bioinformatic manipulations of the data have already been carried out , mostly dealing with the functional analysis of the genes described .
specific search tools have also been developed .
the identification of two-dimensional spots by mass spectrometry has also been demonstrated .
hydrolysis kinetics of three of the pnmcs were reported .
this study is the first to investigate pup preweaning growth and survival rates over seven consecutive breeding seasons in subantarctic fur seals , arctocephalus tropicalis , on amsterdam island , southern indian ocean .
growth and survival were studied in relation to year and pup sex , birth date , birth mass , and growth rate at 60 days of age .
the pup growth rate decreased over the 7-year study period and was the lowest ever found in otariids , which suggests that lactating females experience constant low food availability .
male and female pups grew and survived at similar rates .
no relationship was found between pup growth rate , pup survival rate , and sea-surface temperature ( sst ) gradient during the study period , especially during the later years of good trophic conditions ( i.e. , a high sst gradient ) .
food specialization by european badgers ( meles meles ) is a largely debated controversy .
data from mediterranean areas indicate small importance of earthworms ( lumbricus spp. ) in badger diet and support the idea that badgers are generalist predators .
nevertheless , only dry areas have been sampled so far .
we studied badger diet in six areas along an elevation gradient with different rainfall and habitat conditions , which influenced earthworm availability .
we evaluated the influence of earthworm availability on badger diet along this environmental gradient .
badgers used a wide range of prey items in the different habitats and seasons sampled .
in contrast with other mediterranean studies , earthworms made an important contribution to badger diet ( 27 % of estimated volume ) .
earthworm occurrence in the diet was high in elevated and wet habitats and in spring and autumnâwinter .
earthworm consumption was nonlinearly related to availability , indicating high intake compared with availability in wet areas .
moreover , in summer , availability was virtually zero in all habitats , whereas consumption averaged 15 % volume of the diet .
we tentatively suggest that badgers compensate for variations in earthworm availability by changing their foraging tactics .
this suggests that badgers could be viewed as specialist foragers for earthworms in some mediterranean environments .
the domain structure changed near the threshold field .
the work function is calculated using richardson &apos;s equation .
growth hormone ( gh ) is primarily produced in the pituitary gland , although gh gene expression also occurs in the central and autonomic nervous systems .
neural gh is also present in neonates , juveniles , and adults and is independent of changes in pituitary gh secretion .
neural gh is therefore likely to have local roles in neural development or neural function , especially as gh receptors ( ghrs ) are widespread in the nervous system .
in recent studies , gh mrna and gh immunoreactive proteins have been identified in the neural retina of embryonic chicks .
gh immunoreactivity is present in the optic cup of chick embryos at embryonic day ( ed ) 3 of the 21-d incubation period .
it is widespread in the neural retina by ed 7 but also present in the nonpigmented retina , choroid , sclera , and cornea .
these small gh moieties may reflect proteolytic fragments of &quot; monomer &quot; gh and ( or ) the presence of different gh gene transcripts , since full-length and truncated gh cdnas are present in retinal tissue extracts .
the gh immunoreactivity in the retina persists throughout embryonic development but is not present in juvenile birds ( after 6 weeks of age ) .
this immunoreactivity is also associated with the presence of gh receptor ( ghr ) immunoreactivity and ghr mrna in ocular tissues of chick embryos .
an improved five-step procedure has been developed for the synthesis of the gibberellin plant growth inhibitor 16,17-dihydro-ga5 from gibberellic acid .
the 3-13c and 3-14c derivatives of this material have also been prepared by excising c-3 from the carbon skeleton ( ozonolysis of a î2-alkene derivative and subsequent retro-claisen reaction ) and then reassembling the a-ring by means of an intramolecular aldol reaction .
full-sib progeny tests with clonal replicates may provide better breeding value estimates and the greatest genetic gain in a tree improvement program .
clonal breeding values ( cbv ) that combine the family and within-family breeding values due to additive genetic effects can maximize the genetic gain for advanced generation breeding .
clonal genetic values ( cgv ) that further incorporate full-sib family specific combining ability due to nonadditive genetic effect can maximize gain for a deployment program with clonal propagation techniques .
a blup method for determining both the cbv and cgv for full-sib clonal progeny tests was proposed in this paper .
the formulas for cbv and cgv were derived using general blup methodology , and formulas were derived for the calculations of their standard errors .
an analytical method by using a standard statistical package ( sas proc mixed ) was presented for cbv and cgv calculations from any full-sib mating designs .
we report solid-state 25mg nmr , x-ray crystallographic , and quantum-mechanical calculation results for bis(pyridine)(5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrinato)magnesium(ii) , mg(tpp)·py2 .
the mg(ii) ion is coordinated to four nitrogen atoms from the porphyrin ring and two nitrogen atoms from the axial pyridine ligands , forming a regular octahedron .
the 25mg quadrupole coupling constant ( cq ) is 15.32 ± 0.02 mhz , which represents the largest value so far observed for 25mg nuclei .
the electric field gradient tensor at the mg site is axially symmetric , hq = 0.00 ± 0.05 .
the 25mg chemical shielding anisotropy is too small to be accurately determined .
quantum-mechanical calculations using a 631g(d) basis set reproduce reasonably well the observed 25mg nmr data for mg(tpp)·py2 .
the calculations also suggest that the span of the 25mg chemical shift tensor is less than 50 ppm .
using a theoretical approach , we also investigate the dependence of the 25mg quadrupole coupling constant on the mgnax bond distance .
the calculation suggests that the 25mg quadrupole coupling constant for an mg(ii) ion at the center of a porphyrin ring without axial ligands is approximately 22 mhz , which may be treated as an upper limit of the 25mg quadrupole coupling constant for all mgporphy rin complexes .
morphological shade-avoidance responses have been hypothesized to be a form of adaptive plasticity to improve competition for light ; however , little is known about their intraspecific variability and their effect on reproductive fitness .
to compare plant responses either at a common age or at a common phenological stage , two experiments were conducted with early- and late-flowering chenopodium album plants exposed to different red ( 660 nm ) to far red ( 730 nm ) ratios .
in the first experiment , plant height and number of leaves were recorded at several times during the vegetative stage , and at the onset of flowering , each plant was harvested and other growth traits were measured .
in the second experiment , three destructive harvests were performed across the whole plant cycle .
plant growth and development markedly differed between early- and late-flowering plants in all of the conditions tested .
light treatments significantly affected stem length , total leaf number , total leaf area , and relative allocation to leaf biomass .
in all families , the response of stem elongation to light treatments decreased later in the development , while changes in the other plastic responses were mostly due to variations in plant growth .
no significant treatment effect was found on relative biomass allocation to reproductive structures .
however , individual seed mass significantly differed between certain groups , indicating that light quality can affect reproductive fitness through changes in traits other than fruit or seed set .
according to the definition of molecular connectivity and the definition of a hyper-wiener index , a novel set of hyper-wiener indexes ( rn , mrn ) are defined and are named the extended hyper-wiener indexes .
where n = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , .. represents the type of subgraph units and is the number of endmost atoms of the subgraph unit , m is the number of atoms of the subgraph unit .
the potential usefulness of the extended hyper-wiener index in qsar and ( or ) qspr is evaluated by its correlation with a number of c3c8 alkanes and by a favorable comparison with models based on the molecular connectivity index and the overall wiener index .
to verify the robustness and the predictive ability of the models , a cross-validation procedure , leave-one-out , and a random test were also performed .
the results show that the extended hyper-wiener indexes examined demonstrate a good potential for qsar and qspr studies .
considerably better statistics are obtained when extending the hyper-wiener index to the extended hyper-wiener index .
the extended hyper-wiener indexes provided statistical results as good as the molecular connectivity indexes and the overall wiener index in all models , and the standard deviations provided by these three sets of indexes are rather close .
moreover , this method may provide a better way to apply the wiener number and the hyper-wiener index to the system of unsaturated hydrocarbons and organic compounds , including heteroatoms , according to the method of the molecular connectivity index .
this can extend the usefulness of the wiener number and hyper-wiener index and can make them a kind of widely used topological index in practice .
a primary linkage map of the domestic turkey ( meleagris gallopavo ) was developed by segregation analysis of genetic markers within a backcross family .
this reference family includes 84 offspring from one f1 sire mated to two dams .
genomic dna was digested using one of five restriction enzymes , and restriction fragment length polymorphisms were detected on southern blots using probes prepared from 135 random clones isolated from a whole-embryo cdna library .
dna sequence was subsequently determined for 114 of these cdna clones .
the current map , based on expressed genes , includes 138 loci , encompassing 113 loci arranged into 22 linkage groups and an additional 25 loci that remain unlinked .
the average distance between linked markers is 6 cm and the longest linkage group ( 17 loci ) measures 131 cm. the total map distance contained within linkage groups is 651 cm. the present map provides an important framework for future genome mapping in the turkey .
challenged by work on the panarctic flora project and apparent discrepancies in recent taxonomic treatments , the genus dupontia was studied from herbarium specimens , including types and chromosome vouchers , and by numerical taxonomy , mapping the distribution of morphological characteristics , consideration of chromosome numbers , and field work in the canadian arctic .
our results using these techniques show random variability in many characters and differences in plant size that appear to be partly habitat related .
the treatment of the genus has varied from the recognition of one variable species to three or more distinct species .
morphological characters , used in the literature to divide the genus dupontia into more than one taxon , cannot be reliably applied to distinguish most north american plants .
continuous morphological variation in combination with high and variable ploidy levels , effective vegetative growth , and rare sexual reproduction suggests the use of a broad species concept .
until further evidence is available , our results support treating the genus as monotypic .
genetic variation was examined for moose ( alces alces ) from riding mountain , isle royale , and pukaskwa national parks ; northwestern , nipigon , northeastern , and central ontario ; new brunswick ; and newfoundland .
the national parks were identified as maintaining potentially different local selection pressures due to the absence of hunting and the presence or absence of the parasite parelaphostrongylus tenuis .
genetic variation was estimated using neutral dna markers , assessed by multilocus dna fingerprinting and five microsatellite loci , and the functional antigen binding region ( ars ) ( exon 2) of the major histocompatibility complex ( mhc ) gene drb .
there was discordance in the allelic diversity observed at the neutral loci compared with the mhc drb locus in a number of populations .
ontario populations demonstrated higher levels of variability at the neutral loci and relatively low levels at the drb locus .
conversely , the isle royale population has the lowest genetic variability , consistent with a historic small founding event , at the neutral dna markers and relatively high variability at the mhc gene .
relatively high levels of genetic variation at the drb locus were observed in protected park populations concomitant with the absence of white-tailed deer ( odocoileus virginianus ) or the parasite p. tenuis and an absence of hunting .
gene flow was observed among the neighboring geographic regions within ontario , including pukaskwa national park , with evidence of isolation-by-distance among more distant regions within ontario .
the discordant patterns between dna markers suggest that neutral dna markers may not accurately reflect adaptive variation present at functional loci .
new petrological , geochronological , and geochemical data on basalts , mugearites , peralkaline trachytes , and phonolites from the baringobogoria basin , central kenya rift , are presented .
kar dating indicates that the volcanic rocks were emplaced between 894 ± 13 and 92 ± 5 ka. 87sr/86sr ranges from 0.70304 to 0.70692 , 143nd/144nd from 0.51237 to 0.51295 , 206pb/204pb from 18.4 to 19.8 , 207pb/204pb from 15.46 to 15.70 , and 208pb/204pb from 38.2 to 40.5 .
despite a rather restricted sampling area and a relatively short time span ( &#91;image&#93;820 ka ) , the mineralogical and geochemical variations are not consistent with a simple cogenetic link between the lavas .
the studied area is located in a transition zone between two different lithospheric domains ( tanzanian craton and panafrican mobile belt ) .
we propose that the petrological and geochemical variations of the studied lavas are essentially linked to the nature of the underlying lithosphere .
some basaltic products underwent carbonate contamination , possibly within the crust .
trachytes and phonolites are derived from different basaltic parents through crustal assimilation coupled with fractional crystallization .
one phonolite sample contains primary calcite-rich veinlets .
textural relations and geochemical evidence suggest that there is a direct cogenetic link between these carbonate and phonolite melts .
the veinlets are the modal expression of a carbonate component included in all the phonolites from the baringobogoria basin .
chydorus brevilabris , daphnia ambigua , daphnia cf. pulex , and graptoleberis testudinaria had a preference for eutrophic lakes , whereas acroperus harpae , alonella nana , alonella excisa , chydorus piger , daphnia cf. dentifera , and eubosmina spp. were found in the less productive lakes .
predictive models to estimate tp from species abundance data were developed using weighted averaging techniques .
many models have been developed to evaluate the operating speeds on two-lane rural highways .
however , provided information usually lacks details essential to assess their applicability at locations other than where they were developed .
this paper presents a procedure to interpret raw data collected on three horizontal curve sites of different two-lane rural highway classes in ontario .
the speed observations were categorized into three vehicle classes ( passenger car , light truck , and multi-axle heavy truck ) and four light condition categories ( day , night , and two transition periods ) .
the minimum headway and percentile value to define the operating speed were examined , and a revision of the current practice deemed not warranted .
the findings also indicated that operating speeds do not depend on the time or vehicle class .
finally , the horizontal alignment affects the operating speed , but the speeds of the two travel directions on a horizontal curve may differ even with little contribution of the vertical alignment .
the objectives of this study were to test the free ion model of cd phytoavailability in solutions where the dissolved free ion was buffered by so4 or edta and to examine if cd2+ diffusion to roots might be limiting to its accumulation in roots .
at similar cd2+ activities , solutions that contained edta or a higher nominal so4 concentration ( with so4 supplied as k2so4 , and more total cd ) resulted in greater accumulation of cd by roots than predicted by the cd2+ activity .
we conclude that cdedta2 and cdso04 ( aq ) could have alleviated this diffusion limitation by buffering cd2+ at the root surface and ( or ) been taken up directly as a complex .
chromosomes and nuclear dna amount were analyzed in leaf tissues of luzula nivea , luzula luzuloides , and luzula multiflora .
intra- and interspecific karyological variability was stated .
chromosome numbers in diploids ranged 2n = 8-24 in l. nivea and l. luzuloides and 2n = 12-84 in hexaploid l. multiflora .
karyological variability resulted mainly from chromosome fission ( agmatoploidy ) and aneusomaty ; chromosome fusion ( symploidy ) and polyploidy were also involved .
flow cytometric determination of nuclear genome size using propidium iodide staining gave values of 1.584 pg in l. luzuloides , 1.566 pg in l. nivea , and 3.034 pg in l. multiflora .
variability in relative nuclear genome size within species was measured by 4&apos;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining .
in contrast with previous reports , variability was fairly small and ranged from 1.796 to 1.864 pg in l. luzuloides , from 1.783 to 1.847 pg and from 1.737 to 1.808 pg in two populations ( s and f) of l. nivea , respectively , and from 3.125 to 3.271 pg in l. multiflora .
an intraplant ( interleaf ) genome size variation was also observed and its possible causes are discussed .
the additions of a strong base ( naoh ) , strong acid ( hcl ) , organic acid ( citric acid ) , and sodium acetate to waste sludge all facilitated the release of phosphate into solution .
the maximum phosphate release was obtained by adding 4.9 mmole/l ( ~400 mg/l ) of acetate to an intermittently mixed digester .
excess amounts of acetate did not further increase the phosphate concentrations .
acetate addition , which triggers carbon storage , a unique characteristic of enhanced biological phosphorus removal ( ebpr ) processes , releases internally stored phosphate compounds and is recommended as a method for releasing phosphates from ebpr sludges .
along with phosphates , various cations ( most notably magnesium and potassium ) were also mobilized and released into solution during digestion using acetate .
these ions can be beneficially reused for struvite crystallization .
siliceous shrubs constitute a major precipitate style associated with discharge channel  flow-path facies throughout most of the 20 m of flow path at cistern spring , norris geyser basin .
they are found in siliceous spring waters ranging in temperature from 76.4 to 16.2 °c and ph from 6.0 to 7.4 .
at every scale , siliceous shrubs contain abundant evidence of microbial life in the form of bacterial body fossils and extracellular polymeric substances .
the presence of relict organic constituents and bacterial morphological fossils indicates that the shrub fabric and architecture are dominated by bacteria , i.e. , there is potentially a strong biotic effect on the precipitation process .
precipitation of opal in siliceous shrubs is very likely the result of either active bacterially induced precipitation or passive mediation through organic templates .
on a larger scale , siliceous shrubs contain abundant evidence of former microbial activity in hot springs , thus they are good microbial biomarkers .
female flowers of some dioecious species are known to develop stamens with sterile pollen , a sexual system known as cryptic dioecy .
planch. ex maxim .
these results strongly support the pollinator attraction hypothesis in a. polygama .
given the evident role of stamens in female flowers in a. polygama reproduction , we discuss why cryptic dioecy is a rare phenomenon .
also , swimming activity was monitored as an indicator of emigration .
the difference in growth rates with respect to behavior category was highest at intermediate food levels .
at the highest and lowest food levels , nonterritorial fish and floaters grew nearly as fast or as poorly , respectively , as the territorial individuals .
cms were diatrizoate ( urografin® 76 % ) for ionic cm and iopamidol ( iopamiron® 370 ) for nonionic cm. swine red blood cells ( rbcs ) were suspended in autologous plasma containing diatrizoate ( uro ) , iopamidol ( iop ) , and saline ( sal ) at 6.7 % w/w , as well as in plasma alone ( pla ) , at 40 % of the hematocrit .
sigmoid sedimentation curves were fitted to the puccini et al. ( 1977 ) equation , and the average number of rbcs per aggregate m was calculated by stokes &apos; law against the time t. according to the muratasecomb ( 1988 ) theory we estimated the collision rate k between two aggregates from dm/dt in the stationary phase during sedimentation .
corresponding to the maximal esr , the dm/dt ( in cells/s ) was 0.52 in pla , 0.09 in sal , 0.06 in uro and 0.03 in iop , so that k also decreased in proportion to dm/dt from 145 fl/s in pla to 8 fl/s in iop .
both the ionic and nonionic cms tend to inhibit the rbc aggregation more than that in sal ; the latter iopamidol appears to be inhibitory more than the former diatrizoate in autologous plasma .
mo3sb7 was synthesized by heating the elements in the stoichiometric ratio in a sealed silica tube at 700 °c .
the title compounds aî´mo3sb7 ( a = mg , ni , cu ) were prepared by annealing prereacted mo3sb7 with different amounts of a in powder form between 500 and 750 °c .
according to our single-crystal structure studies , the a atoms can be intercalated in small amounts into the cubic voids of the mo3sb7 structure without noticeable symmetry changes ( space group im&#91;image&#93;m ) .
the different cations cause different band-gap decreases that depend on the element as well as its concentration .
moult intensity and chronology in staging eastern-population ( ep ) tundra swans ( cygnus columbianus columbianus ) were studied during spring in 1999 and 2000 ( n = 35 ) and during fall in 1999 , 2000 , and 2001 ( n = 47 ) at long point , lake erie , ontario .
to test for age , sex , and seasonal differences in molt intensity , 20 feather regions were scored according to the proportion of growing feathers .
adult , subadult , and juvenile tundra swans molted contour feathers at low intensities during spring and fall .
males and females of all three age classes had similar patterns and intensities of molt during spring and fall .
shared costs of incubation and brood rearing , perennial monogamy , and lack of a breeding plumage could be some of the pressures selecting for intersexual similarities in feather replacement during migration .
adult , subadult , and juvenile tundra swans molted more intensively during fall than spring .
larger lipid reserves and seasonal dietary differences may allow fall-staging tundra swans to molt more intensively than spring-staging birds at long point .
overlap of nutritionally costly events ( molt and migration ) may be necessary as tundra swans spend half of their annual cycle on spring and fall staging areas .
however , reduced daily nutritional costs associated with molting at low intensities and migrating slowly apparently permits the overlap of these two life-cycle events .
spotted salamander ( ambystoma maculatum ) distributions were studied within eighteen 272-m2 field enclosures in upland deciduous forest adjacent to two breeding ponds .
the enclosures were subsequently used in experiments involving (i) removal of small-mammal burrows to determine if burrow abundance influenced salamander density and ( ii ) manipulation of salamander densities to determine if increased density was associated with decreased growth , fecundity , or probability of re-emerging to breed .
mean density of salamanders wintering in enclosures &lt;65 m from the breeding ponds was 1.0/100 m2 ( sd = 1.1/100 m2 , n = 17 , range = 04.0/100 m2 ) .
density declined as distance to the nearest breeding pond increased , and the sex ratio was skewed sharply toward males ( 8:1 ) wintering close ( &lt;65 m) to the pond but not farther from the pond ( 1:1 ) .
males residing within the enclosures weighed more than males wintering farther from the breeding ponds .
migrating salamanders were over 3 times more likely to leave burrow-removal plots than control plots prior to the summer inactive period .
salamanders housed at high density ( 15/enclosure ) were less likely to re-emerge to breed than were salamanders housed at low density ( 5/enclosure ) , but we observed no effects on growth or fecundity .
results suggest that conspecific distribution and burrow availability might affect the density of spotted salamanders within terrestrial habitats .
we sought to determine the efficiency of the intracellular functional p-gp- and mrp1-mediated pumping of thp into acidic organelles in siha cells and etoposide-resistant siha/vp16 cells .
the expression of both mdr1 and mrp1 genes of siha and siha/vp16 cells was clearly shown by using rtpcr .
the functional studies of both intracellular functional p-gp- and mrp1-mediated pumping were performed by using thp in a conventional spectrofluorometer , and they demonstrated that siha and siha/vp16 cells are good models to illustrate the functional role of intracellular p-gp and mrp1 in the transport of free cytosolic drug into acidic organelles .
the functional p-gp and mrp1 proteins were identified both on plasma membranes and on intracellular vesicle membranes .
within the limit of experimental error , similar efficiencies in thp transport were observed in the two proteins at both locations in siha and siha/vp16 cells .
the p-gp- and mrp1-mediated pump coefficient ( kav ) , michealismenten&apos;s constant ( kmv ) , and maximal pumping rate ( vmaxv ) values of those located on vesicular membranes were 1.87 ± 0.30 pl·cell1·s1 , 1.63 ± 0.21 mm , and 4.95 ± 0.45 nm·s1 , respectively .
drug retention inside acidic organelles ( cvmon ) of siha cells was significantly higher than that of siha/vp16 cells , perhaps a consequence of slower movement of recycling endosomes and ( or ) lysosomes to the cell membrane of siha cells , leading to distended organelles and cell death .
our results suggest that intracellular p-gp and mrp1 proteins play an important role in the transport of free drug from cytosol to cytoplasmic acidic organelles .
this paper describes an experimental study conducted using a large , laboratory-scale testing facility to test pile segments at different stress levels .
the objectives of the study were twofold : to examine the load-transfer mechanism of tapered piles in compression , and to evaluate the effect of pile material on pile performance characteristics .
the results of axial compressive loading tests on 26 pile load tests were presented using fiber-reinforced polymer ( frp ) concrete composite tapered piles and steel piles .
two installation techniques were used , including conventional head driving and toe driving using a new technique .
piles were tested at different confining pressures to represent a pile segment at depths of 4.0 and 8.0 m. the load distribution along the pile shafts was measured and the results were compared with those from an analytical solution in terms of the taper coefficient kt. the comparison showed reasonable agreement between kt values established from the experiments and those obtained from the analytical solution .
a simple rational approach was proposed for the design of tapered piles .
knowledge of the feeding ecology of mammalian herbivores is fundamental in predicting their responses to habitat change .
where native woodlands are newly established in open moorland , the extent to which trees form part of the diet of mountain hares ( lepus timidus ) is unknown .
this information is necessary for predicting the potential effects of mountain hare browsing on woodland establishment .
the n-alkanes and a long-chain fatty alcohols found in the cuticular wax of diet plants and feces ( n = 240 ) were used as markers to estimate the composition of the diet of mountain hares in an area of moorland with newly established pinus sylvestris and betula pubescens woodland .
during winter , the diet of mountain hares was dominated by calluna vulgaris , but there was a seasonal shift to a diet dominated by grasses , sedges , and rushes in summer .
pinus sylvestris and b. pubescens were minor dietary components in all seasons .
a higher proportion of grasses , sedges , and rushes was found in the diet of lactating females .
results suggest that when an alternative browse species such as c. vulgaris is widely available , mountain hares may not have a large impact on the establishment of native woodland .
the dietary results from this study are in broad agreement with those from previous studies using other techniques .
we estimated time from death to fall ( standing time ) of norway spruce ( picea abies ( l. ) karst. ) snags in a submountainous old-growth forest in south-central norway , applying four calculation methods to 124 dendro chrono logically cross-dated still-standing snags and 64 fallen logs .
the calculation methods consistently estimated expected standing time of snags at 2634 years , with a median of 1621 years and 20 % of snags standing for &gt;4858 years .
the survival function from all methods took the approximate form of a negative exponential , with a 3%4 % annual fall rate for snags .
in the distribution of time since death , a small peak in dead trees 2030 years ago ( late 1970s ) coincides with a historic epidemic of bark beetles .
the method using only time since death of still-standing snags appears to be the most feasible for estimating total standing time of snags in old-growth forests with constant tree mortality .
heterogeneous platinum catalysts ( pt/sio2 ) obtained by the sol-gel process at ph 3 and 9 have been used in the hydrosilylation reaction of 1-alkynes using various silanes .
once the catalysts were activated they were used in the hydrosilylation of 1-alkynes after a short induction period .
the product distribution was quite similar in either case but important differences in catalytic activity and turnover reactions were observed .
the catalyst obtained in the basic medium after each reaction lost its catalytic activity , so further activation was needed .
the 29si cpmas nmr studies showed the presence of terminal and bridged hydroxyl groups in the pt/sio2 catalyst at ph = 9 .
similar results were observed by ft ir analysis because of the catalysts &apos; synthetic conditions .
we developed a time series model of secchi depth for lake tahoe incorporating a mechanistic understanding of interannual variability with sufficient simplicity to allow data-based parameter estimation .
secchi depth is still occasionally over 40 m at lake tahoe , but mean annual secchi depth has declined nearly 10 m since 1967 , prompting a large-scale restoration program .
year-to-year variability is extremely high , obscuring restoration actions and compliance with water quality standards .
the model focused on secchi depth during summer , when the lake is least transparent and most heavily used .
interannual variability for the summer season is driven largely by precipitation differences .
the model offers a means for determining compliance with water quality standards when precipitation anomalies may persist for years .
as demonstrated by means of an ex-post forecast , increasing secchi depths during 1999â2001 were simply climate-driven and do not represent a recovery of the lake .
the long-term trend for summer is most likely due to the accumulation of allochthonous mineral suspensoids .
wolbachia-infected ostrinia scapulalis ( lepidoptera : crambidae ) females generate all-female or nearly all-female broods .
curing the infection by tetracycline treatment during larval stages results in the generation of all-male broods in the next generation .
heer we show that sexually mosaic offspring are produced by wolbachia-infected females treated with tetracycline at the adult stage .
the sexual mosaics had wings that were composed of distinctive female and male sectors .
besides wings , the sexually dimorphic mid tibiae displayed an intermediate morphology in some of the mosaics .
many of the mosaic individuals had an abnormal structure of the external genitalia as well , a combination of the male uncus and the female ovipositor .
a monte carlo computational method for simulating the growth of entire ice crystals from the liquid phase has been developed specifically to study the inhibition of ice-crystal growth by antifreeze proteins ( afps ) .
afps are found in the fluids of certain organisms that inhabit freezing environments and constrain ice-crystal growth by adsorbtion to the ice surface , but their inhibition mechanism is still poorly understood .
thus , it was of interest to incorporate these molecules into the dynamic ice simulations to examine the inhibition phenomenon on a whole-crystal basis .
we have undertaken simulations with afps from two different organisms that differ in activity ; the insect afp has up to 100 times the activity of the fish afp on a molar basis .
simulations involving insect and fish afps have achieved ice-growth inhibition at simulation temperatures within reported activity ranges for both fish and insect afps , accompanied by resulting ice morphologies similar to those observed experimentally .
the oldman river watershed in southern alberta , canada , is an extensively irrigated region in which intensive agricultural practices have flourished .
concern over water quality in the basin has been expressed because of high levels of enteric disease indigenous to the region .
to address these concerns , we conducted a 2-year study to estimate the prevalence of escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella spp. in surface water within the basin .
this study is the first of its kind to identify e. coli o157:h7 repeatedly in surface water collected from a canadian watershed .
prevalence of e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella spp. in water samples was 0.9 % ( n = 1483 ) and 6.2 % ( n = 1429 ) , respectively .
while data examined at a regional level show a relationship between high livestock density and high pathogen levels in southern alberta , statistical analysis of point source data indicates that predicted manure output from bovine , swine , and poultry feeding operations was not directly associated with either salmonella spp. or e. coli o157:h7 prevalence .
however , geography and weather variables , which are likely to influence bacterial runoff , were not considered in this model .
we also postulate that variations in time , amount , and frequency of manure application onto agricultural lands may have influenced levels of surface-water contamination with these bacterial pathogens .
we have made a comparative study of the dediazoniation of p-hydroxy and p-nitrobenzenediazonium ions .
the electron-withdrawing and donating properties of the -no2 and -oh groups strongly determine the reactivity of both compounds , thus exerting different influences upon the dediazoniation reaction .
we describe here how the decomposition of p-hydroxy and p-nitrobenzenediazonium ions in a neutral aqueous medium follows a different pattern in the presence of the metal-chelator diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid ( dtpa ) .
the decomposition rate of p-hydroxybenzene diazonium decreases whilst the decomposition of the p-nitrobenzenediazonium ion is enhanced .
the experimental data are discussed with reference to a common scheme of interference for both benzenediazonium ions in the light of the radical-scavenging capacity of dtpa .
sexual differences in habitat use of map turtles ( graptemys spp. ) have been attributed to differences in swimming ability as influenced by body size , because females are much larger than males , or to sexual differences in diet .
captures of young female graptemys versa , which had body sizes similar to those of adult males but diet and trophic morphology more similar to those of larger females , allowed testing of these alternative hypotheses .
a variety of single habitat variables measured at the sites of capture performed poorly in separating the three groups of turtles , but multivariate analysis and variables relating to position within the stream produced greater separation , indicating that complex combinations of factors probably influence habitat use .
young females were more similar in their habitat use to large females than to males , and their diet was also more similar to that of larger females , due primarily to the quantities of mollusks consumed .
the data supported the hypothesis that habitat separation was the result of dietary rather than body size differences .
while dietary differences are probably facilitated by sexual size dimorphism , they may not be the ultimate selective force that produced the size dimorphism .
the developmental profiles and tissue distribution of the four cyanogenic compounds in seedlings of two developmentally contrasting inbred lines of flax ( linum usitatissimum l. ) were examined using hplc .
during germination , the isoleucine-derived compound , neolinustatin , was hydrolyzed faster in the more vigorous of the two lines .
furthermore , in this line , the neolinustatin content was higher in seeds and the accumulation of the other isoleucine-derived compound , lotaustralin , was also higher in the cotyledons of seedlings .
in contrast , with one exception , the hydrolysis and accumulation of the valine-derived compounds , linustatin and linamarin , was the same in both lines .
differences in the levels of the compounds during germination , and in the hypocotyls , are interpreted as evidence for the involvement of transient levels of hydrogen cyanide in the autocatalytic regulation of ethylene production .
insulin excess exacerbates hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats ( shr ) .
this study examined the relative contribution of the reninangiotensin system and the sympathetic nervous system in this phenomenon .
in shr , daily subcutaneous injections of insulin were initiated either before short-term angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with captopril or after lifetime captopril treatment .
insulin treatment resulted in significant increases in mean arterial pressure and heart rate and captopril treatment lowered arterial pressure , but captopril did not lower arterial pressure more in the insulin-treated compared with control rats .
these data indicate that in shr , the ability of insulin to increase blood pressure is closely related to sympathoexcitation , which is unresponsive to blockade of angiotensin-converting enzyme .
described are the synthesis and characterization of ru(ii) complexes of the type rucl2l2(n-o) , where l2 is either 1,4-bis(diphenylphosphino)butane ( dppb ) or (pph3)2 , and n-o represents chelated 2-benzoylpyridine ( 2-bzpy ) or 2-acetylpyridine ( 2-acpy ) ; the ru presursors used were &#91;rucl2(dppb)&#93;2(µ-dppb) or rucl2(pph3)3 .
in all cases , thermodynamically stable cis-complexes are formed from initially formed trans-species .
the upper bay of fundy is a critical staging area for migrating semipalmated sandpipers ( calidris pusilla ) , which feed extensively on the amphipod corophium volutator .
recent changes in the distributions of birds around the bay have generated interest in understanding the factors that influence shorebirds &apos; habitat use .
to examine some of these factors , we surveyed four mud flats during summer 2000 .
abundance of shorebirds and density of c. volutator and mud snails ( ilyanassa obsoleta ) were assessed in two focused areas and on two broad-scale transects per mud flat .
shorebird abundance varied widely across sites , and was positively correlated with c. volutator availability , though the relationship had little predictive ability .
a strong negative relationship was identified between shorebirds and mud snails counted before birds arrived , especially in the focused areas .
this relationship probably stems from a negative effect of mud snails on c. volutator .
snails present in july may reduce recruitment of c. volutator , and therefore reduce the prey base for shorebirds arriving later in the summer .
by considering mud snail abundance , we have identified a simple and effective method of predicting shorebird habitat use several weeks before birds arrive .
this will enhance our ability to study these birds in future , and will contribute to our understanding of shorebird habitat use and movements and the importance of conserving particular mud flats .
the water chemistry of the euphotic zone in 12 lakes within burned and reference watersheds on alberta &apos;s boreal plain was surveyed two years post-fire .
five burned and four reference lakes were located in the boreal foothills ( mean elevation = 1048 m) and three reference lakes were situated at lower elevations in the boreal mixedwood ecoregion ( 748 m) .
mean dissolved organic carbon ( doc ) concentration in lake water from burned watersheds was 1.4-fold higher than in lake water from reference foothills watersheds , whereas lake color increased with the area of catchment burned divided by lake volume ( r = 0.98 ) .
reference mixedwood lakes had higher mean total phosphorus ( tp , 1.8-fold ) and chlorophyll a ( chl a ; 4.4-fold ) concentrations than reference foothills lakes .
ten additional lakes from a previous study in boreal alberta were used to further compare water chemistry between ecoregions .
boreal mixedwood lakes ( n = 13 ) had higher tp ( 2.3-fold ) , chl a ( 3-fold ) , and ca2+ + mg2+ ( 3.3-fold ) concentrations than boreal foothills lakes ( n = 9) .
our data suggest an influence of forest fire on lake chemistry in the boreal foothills , and demonstrate the need for an ecoregion approach to detect the impacts of watershed disturbance on the boreal plain .
recently , a new strain of cholera , vibrio cholerae o139 , has emerged as an epidemic strain , but there is little information about its environmental reservoir .
the present investigation was aimed to determine the role of cyanobacteria in the persistence of v. cholerae o139 in microcosms .
an environmental isolate of v. cholerae o139 and three cyanobacteria ( anabaena sp. , nostoc sp. , and hapalosiphon sp. ) were used in this study .
survival of culturable v. cholerae o139 in microcosms was monitored using taurocholate-tellurite gelatin agar medium .
viable but nonculturable v. cholerae o139 were detected using a fluorescent antibody technique .
vibrio cholerae o139 could be isolated for up to 12 days in a culturable form in association with cyanobacteria but could not be isolated in the culturable form after 2 days from control water without cyanobacteria .
the viable but nonculturable v. cholerae o139 could be detected in association with cyanobacteria for up to 15 months .
these results , therefore , suggest that cyanobacteria can act as a long-term reservoir of v. cholerae o139 in an aquatic environment .
microbial communities from three argentinean saline soils were extracted and tested for their ability to degrade diesel fuel in liquid culture at salinities between 0 % and 25 % .
in each case , the degradation process was continuously monitored by measuring oxygen consumption .
two communities ( cr1 and cr2 ) showed nearly equal degrees of degradation across a salinity range of 0%â10 % ( the former degrading about 63 % of the diesel fuel and the latter about 70 % after 53 and 80 d , respectively ) .
furthermore , the degree of degradation was not significantly lower in the presence of 17.5 % salt ( 58 % and 65 % degraded , respectively ) .
a third community ( el zorro ) showed a maximum turnover at 5 % salt ( 79 % diesel fuel degraded ) and significant degradation ( 66 % ) at a salinity of 10 % .
however , the degree of degradation by this community clearly dropped at 0 % and 15 % salt .
none of the communities were able to degrade diesel fuel in the presence of 25 % salt , but the living cell counts showed that components of the microbial population survived the long-term exposure .
the surviving portion is obviously sufficient to allow substantial restoration of the original community , as verified by the biolog method .
isolates of the cr1 community were identified as members of the genera cellulomonas , bacillus , dietzia , and halomonas .
in light of our investigations , the bioremediation of contaminated saline soils should be quite possible if the salinity of the soil water is lower than 15 % or if it is reduced below this limit by the addition of water .
the reaction was found to be regiospecific and syn-diastereoselective .
although trends in reproduction , mortality , and entanglement events have been analyzed for the endangered north atlantic right whale ( eubalaena glacialis ) population , no method has been available to assess individual right whale health .
heer , we describe a technique for assessing health based on evaluation of selected physical parameters from archived photographs of right whales .
a scoring system was developed to assess body and skin condition , blowhole cyamids , and rake marks in over 200 000 photographs .
comparison of body condition scores of females during calving and noncalving years found that females were significantly thinner in calving years and in the year after calving compared with the year before calving , showing that changes in body condition known to occur during the reproductive cycle can be successfully evaluated from photographs .
comparison of scores for all parameters between living whales and whales with more than a 5-year gap in sighting history ( &quot; presumed dead &quot; ) found that presumed dead whales received health assessment scores indicating compromised health with body condition emerging as a key visual indicator .
this health assessment method provides a new tool to monitor health trends in right whales at individual and population levels and may provide a model for assessments of other well-photographed cetaceans .
in 1999 , red spruce ( picea rubens sarg. ) trees in a small area of the halifax regional municipality in nova scotia , atlantic canada , were found to be infested and killed by tetropium fuscum ( fabr . )
( coleoptera : cerambycidae ) , a eurasian species of longhorn beetle .
we isolated and identified the fungi associated with t. fuscum in halifax and compared them with ophiostomatoid fungi associated with tetropium spp. on spruce in europe .
ophiostoma species associated with tetropium cinnamopterum kirby ( indigenous to and transcontinental in canada ) were also compared with those associated with t. fuscum .
strains were identified based on morphological and molecular characters .
ophiostoma piceae ( münch ) syd. &amp; p. syd. , pesotum fragrans mathiesen-käärik , and ophiostoma tetropii mathiesen were the most frequently isolated species .
lack of type material for o. tetropii and discrepancies between the ex-type strain of o. tetropii and its original description prompted us to lectotypify this species and designate epitype material for it .
the results suggest that o. tetropii was introduced with t. fuscum from europe into atlantic canada .
the paper describes an experimental investigation in which two large-scale geosynthetic reinforced soil embankments and one unreinforced soil embankment were taken to collapse under a strip footing placed close to the crest .
one reinforced embankment was constructed with a relatively extensible and weak polypropylene geogrid and the second with a relatively strong and stiff high-density polyethylene geogrid .
the geometry of the unfaced embankments , sand soil , and loading arrangement were the same for all three structures .
the focus of the paper is on the experimental design , construction , testing , and instrumentation techniques used in the investigation and selected test results .
the results of the study show that the ultimate footing load capacity increased with an increase in reinforcement strength ( and stiffness ) and that the reinforced soil embankments had a load capacity up to 1.62.0 times that of the nominal identical control embankment without reinforcement .
these theoretical cross sections are compared with the wannierklar threshold power-law formula and the existing experimental results .
ribosomal gene sequence data were obtained from a nonfruiting culture originally identified as ceratocystis brunnea r.w. davidson ; this species was considered a nomen dubium by upadhyay ( 1981 ) due to a presumptive lack of teleomorph material .
the data showed that c. brunnea is a valid species that should be transferred to ophiostoma , demonstrating that dna data can compensate for the presumed or actual lack of morphological features lost during either long-term culturing or disintegration of holotype specimens .
use of partial large ribosomal sequence data to assess the relationship of c. brunnea to other ophiostoma spp. showed that it is not a synonym of ophiostoma piliferum ( fr.:fr . )
syd. &amp; p. syd. as has been suggested ; instead , it appears to be distantly related to ophiostoma piceae ( münch ) syd. &amp; p. syd .
the data obtained for the ophiostoma piliferum strains included in this study suggest that hardwood-derived isolates may be distinct from those obtained from conifers .
in addition , molecular characters support transferring ceratocystis pseudonigra olchow. &amp; reid , ceratocystiopsis concentrica ( olchow. &amp; reid ) upadhyay , ceratocystiopsis pallidobrunnea ( olchow. &amp; reid ) upadhyay , and ceratocystiopsis crenulata ( olchow. &amp; reid ) upadhyay to ophiostoma .
linkage analyses increasingly complement cytological and traditional plant breeding techniques by providing valuable information regarding genome organization and transmission genetics of complex polyploid species .
this study reports a genome map of buffelgrass ( pennisetum ciliare ( l. ) link syn .
cenchrus ciliaris l. ) .
maternal and paternal maps were constructed with restriction fragment length polymorphisms ( rflps ) segregating in 87 f1 progeny from an intraspecific cross between two heterozygous genotypes .
a survey of 862 heterologous cdnas and gdnas from across the poaceae , as well as 443 buffelgrass cdnas , yielded 100 and 360 polymorphic probes , respectively .
the maternal map included 322 rflps , 47 linkage groups , and 3464 cm , whereas the paternal map contained 245 rflps , 42 linkage groups , and 2757 cm. approximately 70 to 80 % of the buffelgrass genome was covered , and the average marker spacing was 10.8 and 11.3 cm on the respective maps .
preferential pairing was indicated between many linkage groups , which supports cytological reports that buffelgrass is a segmental allotetraploid .
more preferential pairing ( disomy ) was found in the maternal than paternal parent across linkage groups ( 55 vs. 38 % ) and loci ( 48 vs. 15 % ) .
comparison of interval lengths in 15 allelic bridges indicated significantly less meiotic recombination in paternal gametes .
allelic interactions were detected in four regions of the maternal map and were absent in the paternal map .
tree stems contract and expand as stem water is depleted and replaced .
band-dendrometer studies suggest that such daily changes are small ( &lt;0.2 mm diameter ) , and they are ignored in most growth measurements .
however , several studies using other approaches note larger changes ( even &gt;1 cm diameter ) , suggesting that significant biases are possible .
an exploratory study examined the pattern and magnitude of daily stem changes and whether commercial band-dendrometers were able to reveal them .
a method involving multiple precision measurements on eight trees in a bornean hill dipterocarp forest revealed daily shrinkage and expansion of girth of around 1 mm. fluctuations were greater in bright weather .
band-dendrometers detected these changes but revealed less than a tenth of their magnitude .
an analytical model for dendrometer error is presented that predicts how measurement biases can be reduced .
tropical trees can fluctuate appreciably in stem diameter over the day .
influential biases seem especially likely when measurement intervals are short and involve systematic differences in timing and weather .
further study is required to gauge the more general influence of these measurement problems .
previous laboratory and field studies have presented evidence for the existence of limestone ecotypes in white spruce ( picea glauca ( moench ) voss ) .
remeasurements of the range-wide 410 series of provenance trials were used for further evaluation of the existence of these ecotypes .
in 2001 , heights were measured of 23 provenances grown at four test sites in ontario , all located south of 46°n .
bedrock classification for test sites and provenances by limestone or non-limestone parent material was done using a 1993 data set of the ontario geological survey .
analysis of variance revealed significant differences among test sites and provenances only .
no significant interactions consistent with the existence of limestone ecotypes were detected .
this finding is in contrast to that of an earlier field study that detected a strong interaction between test site and provenance bedrock type ( p &lt; 0.001 ) .
examination of the relative performance of individual provenances from limestone and non-limestone bedrock types revealed differences in performance at the four different test sites but few instances supporting the existence of limestone ecotypes .
although these more recent results generally support a pattern of between-stand variation in southern ontario , they do not disprove the existence of limestone ecotypes , owing to the nature of the 410-series test design and the classification of provenances according to bedrock type instead of actual soil analyses .
we construct a model of the two-dimensional equations of generalized thermoelasticity with two relaxation times in an isotropic elastic medium with the modulus of elasticity being dependent on the reference temperature .
the method of the matrix exponential , which constitutes the basis of the state-space approach of modern theory , is applied to the nondimensional equations .
laplace and fourier integral transforms are used .
the resulting formulation is applied to a problem of a thick plate subject to heating on parts of the upper and lower surfaces of the plate , varying exponentially with time .
numerical results are given and illustrated graphically for the problem considered .
yellow starthistle ( centaurea solstitialis l. ) is a major rangeland weed pest in california and other western states .
two complementary aspects of seed biology were examined : germination and seed bank dynamics .
achenes were tested for changes in germinability over time using various light , temperature , and moisture treatments .
soil cores were collected over time to monitor changes in achene density .
both plumed and nonplumed achenes exhibited photo reversible responses to red and far-red light .
white and red light enhanced germination above that occurring in darkness .
achenes showed seasonal changes in germinability , which were characteristic of conditional dormancy .
exposure of achenes to field conditions during summer alleviated primary dormancy , allowing germination to occur at higher temperatures and lower substrate moisture .
nonplumed achenes collected in winter showed reduced germinability at or above moderate temperatures under both single and multiple light exposures .
imbibition and moderately low temperatures with subsequent drying induced secondary conditional dormancy in some achenes .
plumed achenes dominated the soil seed bank before the rainy season , then declined rapidly following rain .
nonplumed achenes peaked after rains began , then declined .
although nearly all achenes were depleted after 4 years , both types remained , showing annual cycles of high and low germinability in autumn and late spring , respectively .
3-aminopyridine is diazotized in the conventional manner and the diazonium salt coupled with n,n â²-dimethylethylenediamine to afford the title compound (1) , which is a potential antitumour agent .
the compound has been characterized by spectroscopic methods .
the 1h nmr spectrum shows evidence of rotational conformerism , from the observation of broadening of the n-methyl signals in the room-temperature spectrum .
low-temperature nmr spectra ( down to 223 k) show the presence of three distinct rotamers .
the crystal structure of 1,2-bis-(1-{3-pyridyl-}3-methyltriazen-3-yl)ethane (1) has been determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction analysis .
the bis-triazene (1) exists as the &quot; staggered &quot; conformation in the solid state , with an &quot; antianti &quot; configuration around the nn bond of the triazene units .
the crystal structure of 1 is compared with the closely related bis-triazene 2 and also compared with the simple mono-triazene 3 .
crystal data for 1 , c14h18n8 : orthorhombic , space group pbca , a = 11.2550(8) å , b = 8.8507(6) å , c = 15.0069(10) å , î² = 90° , and v = 1494.91(18) å3 , for z = 4 .
trichoderma sinensis sp. nov. and trichoderma effusum sp. nov. are additions to trichoderma section longibrachiatum .
trichoderma helicum sp. nov. , trichoderma rossicum sp. nov. , trichoderma velutinum sp. nov. , and trichoderma cerinum sp. nov. are additions to section pachybasium .
trichoderma erinaceum sp. nov. is described in section trichoderma .
the contribution of sequence data in resolving species in trichoderma is demonstrated by trichoderma helicum , which is morphologically indistinguishable from trichoderma tomentosum bissett , even though the two species are not phylogenetically closely related .
millar western forest products ltd. manages a forest in west-central alberta under a forest management agreement ( fma ) with the government of alberta .
part of millar western &apos;s planning process brought researchers together to develop a decision support system ( dss ) for forest management planning and monitoring programs .
for modules  timber supply , biodiversity , fire , and water  were built to evaluate , with the help of indicators of sustainable forest management , current and future forest conditions predicted from computer simulations of alternative management scenarios .
in the first round of assessment four management scenarios , distinct by their level of silviculture intensification and by the spatial clearcut layout pattern , were compared .
a novel variant of soybean kunitz trypsin inhibitor ( skti ) was detected in 530 lines of wild soybean ( glycine soja ) .
this variant showed an intermediate electrophoretic mobility between the tia and tic types .
in isoelectric focusing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels containing urea , this variant had a similar isoelectric point as that of tia .
the genetic analysis of skti bands in f2 seeds from crosses of the new variant type with tia or tic type showed that this variant type is controlled by a codominant allele at the skti locus .
we propose the genetic symbol tif for this novel variant .
when the nucleotide sequence of the tif gene was compared with those of other types of skti genes ( tia , tib , and tic ) , the sequence of tif was identical to that of tib with the exception of one a&#91;image&#93;g transitional mutation occurring at position 676 of tif .
this mutation resulted in an amino acid change from lys to glu at the 178 residue .
these results suggest that this variant is derived from tib through a point mutation .
in addition , we settled an inconsistency in the number of amino acid differences between tia and tib ( eight or nine ) .
analysis of nucleotide and amino acid sequences revealed that tib was different from tia by nine amino acids .
spectrin , a component of the membrane skeleton in erythrocytes and other animal cells , has also been identified in plant and fungal cells .
however , its postulated role , i.e. , the maintenance of shape and elasticity of the plasma membrane , is probably not exerted in walled cells .
to study spectrin in these cells , we chose yeasts because of a high morphological variability of their life cycle .
the localization of spectrin in the cells and protoplasts of saccharomyces cerevisiae and schizosaccharomyces japonicus var. versatilis was detected by immunoblotting , indirect immunofluorescence , and immunogold electron microscopy techniques with the use of anti-chicken and anti-human erythrocyte spectrin antibodies .
a protein band of 220240 kda and some bands of lower relative mass were detected in cell and protoplast extracts of both yeast strains .
spectrin-like proteins were revealed by fluorescence microscopy at cell surfaces and in vacuolar membranes .
immunogold-labeling showed spectrin-like proteins in the plasma membrane , endoplasmic reticulum , vacuoles , nuclei , vesicles , mitochondria , and cell walls .
the topology of spectrin was not affected by actin depolymerization with latrunculin b nor was it changed in either act1-1 or cdc42 mutants , under restrictive conditions .
under osmotic stress , both spectrin and actin were delocalized and appeared in the form of large clusters in the cytoplasm .
it is concluded that a protein cross-reacting with spectrin antibodies is present in fission and budding yeasts .
generally , it is located in the proximity of the plasma membrane and other intracellular membranes , probably as a part of the membrane skeleton .
no evidence of its relationship to either actin or growth zones of the cell can be provided .
based on the social structure of free-living mandarin voles ( lasiopodomys mandarinus ) , high paternal investment might be expected for this species .
this prediction was tested under laboratory conditions .
we observed 10 pairs rearing their first litter .
all pairs exhibited permanent nest cohabitation .
females never prevented males from entering the natal nest .
males exhibited all the patterns of direct care of young except nursing : huddling over , brooding with kyphosis , grooming , manipulating , and retrieving young .
there were no sex differences in total time spent in the nest or in time spent alone .
females spent more time grooming pups than did males .
the frequency of bringing food or nest material into the nest , as well as in digging time , was significantly greater for males than for females .
in l. mandarinus the biparental rearing system with a high level of direct paternal care and some division of labor between the parents seems to be associated with the subterranean mode of life .
this pattern of parental care can be predicted for other specialized fossorial voles .
the st. lawrence estuarine transition zone ( etz ) is a productive ecosystem supporting a larval fish nursery .
since 1994 , dreissena polymorpha veligers have become the dominant zooplankton ( up to 260 individuals·l1 ) .
the environmental factors controlling their distribution across the etz and their potential impact on the plankton were determined .
their horizontal distribution was limited by salinity , with maximum decreases in concentration at 2 .
their vertical distribution was homogeneous throughout the water column , even in the presence of a pycnocline .
redundancy analysis showed that veliger concentrations were positively correlated with temperature and turbidity and negatively correlated with salinity and total phosphorus .
bacterial feas2 mineralization was found in the reddish-brown microbial mats that have grown on the walls of the drainage systems of masutomi hot springs , yamanashi prefecture , japan .
the reddish-brown microbial mats , which are mainly composed of bacilliform and coccoid types of bacteria , have been analyzed and observed by microtechniques to interpret the bacterial biomineralization and search for the clues to bioremediation .
these bacteria accumulate fe and as along with other trace elements to form various biominerals .
the electron diffraction ( ed ) pattern of the bacterial capsule identified lollingite ( feas2 ) and calcite ( caco3 ) on the surface of the cell .
x-ray diffraction ( xrd ) data showed the poorly crystalline character of the precipitates , which consist mainly of hydrous iron oxides ( 2.7 å ( 1 å = 0.1 nm ) ) .
bacterial feas2 mineralization might also be considered a mechanism by which toxic as is removed from the aquatic ecosystem .
the results provide evidence for detoxification processes and offer clues to possible methods of bioremediation .
plant secondary metabolites , such as saponins , have a considerable impact in agriculture because of their allelopathic effects .
they also affect the growth of soil microorganisms , especially fungi .
we investigated the influence of saponins on rhizosphere bacteria in vitro and in soil conditions .
the effects of gypsophila saponins on the growth kinetics of rhizosphere bacteria were studied by monitoring the absorbance of the cultures in microtiter plates .
gypsophila saponins ( 1 % ) increased the lag phase of bacterial growth .
the impact of gypsophila saponins on subterranean clover rhizosphere was also investigated in a pot experiment .
the addition of gypsophila saponins did not modify clover biomass but significantly increased ( twofold with 1 % saponins ) the weight of adhering soil .
the number of culturable heterotrophic bacteria of the clover rhizosphere was not affected by the addition of gypsophila saponins .
nevertheless , the phenotypical characterization of the dominant gram-negative strains of the clover rhizosphere , using the biolog© system , showed qualitative and quantitative differences induced by 1 % saponins .
with the addition of saponins , the populations of chryseomonas spp. and acinetobacter spp. , the two dominant culturable genera of control clover , were no longer detectable or were significantly decreased , while that of aquaspirillum dispar increased and aquaspirillum spp. became the major genus .
aquaspirillum dispar and aquaspirillum spp. were also the dominant rhizosphere bacteria of gypsophila paniculata , which greatly accumulates these saponins in its roots .
these results suggest that saponins may control rhizosphere bacteria in soil through rhizodeposition mechanisms .
faunal homogenization and differentiation occur when geographic regions show increased or decreased , respectively , similarity to each other in species composition owing to introductions and extinctions or extirpations .
i used species presenceabsence data for &quot; native &quot; ( i.e. , estimated species compositions before european settlement ) and &quot; total &quot; ( i.e. , including nonnative fishes and extinctions ) faunas to examine faunal similarity of freshwater fishes among aquatic ecoregions of british columbia and among canadian provinces and territories .
british columbia ecoregions showed faunal differentiation as the mean jaccard &apos;s faunal similarity coefficient for total faunas was significantly less than that for native faunas ( 31.4 % versus 34.9 % ) , but some ecoregions showed homogenization ( e.g. , vancouver island and columbia river ecoregions ) .
comparisons across canada showed low but significant homogenization ; average pairwise jaccard &apos;s coefficient was higher in total versus native faunas ( 29.1 % similarity versus 27.8 % , respectively ) .
british columbia &apos;s fish fauna increased the most in similarity to other areas ( except the three territories ) , with an average increase of 4.9 % .
native faunal similarity patterns are part of canada &apos;s natural heritage but are threatened by human-mediated increases in nonnative species and extinctions .
this analysis provides a baseline to track changes in inter regional faunal relationships at different geographic scales .
cc bond cleavages of radical cations of 2-substituted benzothiazoline derivatives were investigated to determine the parameters controlling the fragmentation rate constants .
in spite of the low oxidation potentials of the compounds , fragmentation rate constants greater than 1 × 106 s1 could be achieved through weakening of the fragmenting bond by substituents that stabilize the radical fragment and exert steric crowding .
a quantitative assessment of the relative roles of radical stabilization vs. steric effects to weaken the fragmenting cc bond was achieved through dft calculations .
the calculated activation enthalpies matched reasonably well with the experimentally determined values .
a thermokinetic analysis revealed that the fragmentations of benzothiazoline radical cations have relatively large intrinsic kinetic barriers , ascribed to the delocalized nature of the product radical and cation fragments .
interestingly , the same factors that lead to the large intrinsic barriers led , simultaneously , to large thermodynamic driving forces for the fragmentations , which should lead to lower activation barriers .
these effects oppose each other kinetically and provide important insight into the design of fast radical ion fragmentation reactions .
the diffracted wave field is studied in the far field of the slit .
this paper presents results of an experimental investigation that examined concrete beams post-tensioned with bonded carbon fiber reinforced polymer ( cfrp ) sheets and then exposed to either room ( +22 °c ) or low ( -28 °c ) temperatures .
the primary objective of this investigation was to assess the flexural behavior of the strengthened beams after sustained loadings at both room and low temperatures .
the strengthened beams showed significant increases in flexural stiffness and ultimate capacity as compared with the control-unstrengthened beams .
failure of the strengthened beams was by tensile rupture of the prestressed cfrp sheets .
test results showed that the long-term and low temperature effects did not adversely affect the strength of the beams .
the load-deflection behavior of the long-term beams was predicted accurately by an analytical model .
these results suggest that bonded prestressed cfrp sheets could be used to increase the strength of damaged prestressed concrete girders under extreme environmental conditions .
the water retention curve ( wrc ) has become a key material function to define the unsaturated behavior of soils and other particulate media .
in many instances , it can be useful to have an estimate of the wrc early in a project , when little or no test results are available .
predictive models , based on easy to obtain geotechnical properties , can also be employed to evaluate how changing parameters ( e.g. , porosity or grain size ) affect the wrc .
in this paper , the authors present a general set of equations developed for predicting the relationship between volumetric water content , î¸ , ( or the corresponding degree of saturation , sr ) and suction , ï .
the proposed model assumes that water retention results from the combined effect of capillary and adhesion forces .
the complete set of equations is given together with complementary relationships developed for specific applications on granular materials and on fine-grained soils .
it is shown that the model provides a simple and practical means to estimate the water retention curve from basic geotechnical properties .
a discussion follows on the capabilities and limitations of the model , and on additional tools developed to complement its use .
overall , fertilization did not have a positive impact on asat , even though fertilization significantly increased foliar nitrogen concentration .
at bf grant , fertilization significantly decreased gs from 0.057 to 0.051 mol·m2·s1 and ci from 217 to 205 µmol·mol1 .
in addition , the decrease in ci associated with fertilization became larger with stand age .
at waycross , fertilization decreased ci from 211 to 203 µmol·mol1 and the interaction between fertilization and stand age was significant for gs and ci. these results indicate that silivcultural practices that increase resource availability and stand growth did not enhance leaf gas exchange .
reactions of terminal chloroaminophosphido complexes with co2(co)8 have been examined .
the ruthenium phosphido complexes &#91; cp*ru(co)2{p(cl)tmp} &#93; ( 1a ) and &#91; cpru(co)2{p(cl)tmp} &#93; ( 1b ) ( tmp = 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyl ) react with co2(co)8 to form the cobalt cluster &#91; co4(co)7(µ-co)3{µ3-p(tmp)} &#93; (2) with complete transfer of the phosphinidene unit to cobalt .
in contrast , the phosphido complex &#91; cp*ru(co)2{p(cl)n-i-pr2} &#93; ( 1c ) affords the spiked-triangular cluster &#91; cp*ruco3(co)8(µ-co)2(µ3-pn-i-pr2) &#93; (3) , which retains the cp*ru unit upon reaction with co2(co)8 .
the molybdenum phosphido complex &#91; cpmo(co)2{p(cl)tmp} &#93; (4) reacts with co2(co)8 to form cluster 2 , while &#91; cp*mo(co)3{p(cl)n-i-pr2} &#93; (5) generates the mixed metal tetrahedral cluster &#91; cp*moco3(co)5(µ-co)4(µ3-pn-i-pr2) &#93; (6) .
in an effort to reexamine the factors that affect codominance of american beech ( fagus grandifolia ehrh. ) and sugar maple ( acer saccharum marsh. ) , a greenhouse experiment was conducted to test the potential phytotoxic effects of american beech leaf leachate on sugar maple seedlings .
we utilized an experimental protocol that addressed phytotoxic , nutrient , and ph effects by watering seedlings with seven treatment solutions : simulated throughfall water , average and dilute concentrations of beech leachate , average and dilute concentrations of maple leachate , and average and dilute concentrations of nutrient solutions .
sugar maple leachate had no effect on sugar maple seedling development , chemistry , or physiology .
however , sugar maple seedlings exposed to average levels of beech leachate had significantly lower leaf area , fewer nodes , lower biomass , higher carbon assimilation rates , and higher stomatal conductance than seedlings exposed to the control solution .
results suggest that secondary compounds in beech leaf leachate are suppressing sugar maple seedling development and that field experiments are needed to explore the potential allelopathic relationship between these species .
stockrecruitment ( sr ) models are commonly fitted to sr data with a least-squares method .
errors in modeling are usually assumed to be normal or lognormal , regardless of whether such an assumption is realistic .
a monte carlo simulation approach was used to evaluate the impact of the assumption of error structure on sr modeling .
the generalized linear model , which can readily deal with different error structures , was used in estimating parameters .
this study suggests that the quality of sr parameter estimation , measured by estimation errors , can be influenced by the realism of error structure assumed in an estimation , the number of sr data points , and the number of outliers in modeling .
a small number of sr data points and the presence of outliers in sr data could increase the difficulty in identifying an appropriate error structure in modeling , which might lead to large biases in the sr param eter estimation .
this study shows that generalized linear model methods can help identify an appropriate error distribution in sr modeling , leading to an improved estimation of parameters even when there are outliers and the number of sr data points is small .
we recommend the generalized linear model be used for quantifying stockrecruitment relationships .
vibro-stone columns can improve the bearing capacity and reduce the settlement of foundations .
their performance depends on the strength of the column material , reinforcement method of column installation , type of in situ soil , area replacement ratio , and column length .
this paper examines the behavior of small laboratory specimens of soft clay ( undrained shear strength â 30 kpa ) reinforced with sand columns when tested under known boundary stress conditions .
two series of tests were carried out on kaolin specimens ( diameter 100 mm , height 200 mm ) in a triaxial cell .
in the second series , columns were reinforced with geo-grids before installation .
the specimens were subjected to (i) uniform loading in which the load was applied over the entire surface area of the specimen or ( ii ) foundation-type loading in which only a small area in the center of the specimen was loaded .
under uniform loading , the specimens containing a full-depth column were significantly stronger than specimens without columns .
specimens with single , partially penetrating columns installed by wet compaction were weaker than specimens without columns .
when frozen columns were installed , strengths increased progressively .
under foundation-type loading , bearing capacities increased with an increase in column length .
geo-grid reinforcement produced significant increases in load-carrying capacity .
a transformation protocol mediated by agrobacterium tumefaciens is described for the sapstaining fungus ophiostoma piceae .
we compared transformants obtained from agrobacterium with those obtained from yeast-like cells made into spheroplasts and treated with cacl2 .
for all putative transformants analyzed , southern hybridization confirmed that the hygromycin resistance gene had been integrated into the genomic dna .
while all transformants obtained from the treated spheroplasts had multiple copy vector insertion , 85 % of the agrobacterium-mediated transformants had single copy vector insertion .
a novel environment lacking in directional cues may present orientation challenges to foraging bees .
we examined orientation and drifting behavior of bombus occidentalis greene and bombus impatiens cresson , the two major bumblebee pollinators of greenhouse tomatoes in british columbia .
our objectives were to establish the extent and frequency of bee drift into foreign colonies and to examine the potential of nest entrance patterns and landmarks to reduce drift in commercial greenhouses .
on average , 28 % of marked bumblebees drifted into foreign hives , making up 0.3%â34.8 % of the population in those colonies .
bees drifted towards the top position when hives were vertically stacked .
the use of simple black and white patterns and large landmarks did not affect the number of drifting bees , suggesting that disorientation is not a major contributor to drift or to the substantial loss of adult bees from colonies during their first week in a greenhouse .
bees had decreased foraging times when landmarks were present in the greenhouse and showed a marginally but not significantly increased rate of pollen input to colonies .
these studies contribute to understanding bumblebee behavior in a novel environment and determining whether orientation cues are feasible management options to reduce drift and potential bee loss .
the analysis of f2 progeny and derived f3 families of lactuca sativa segregating for resistance to corky root rot caused by rhizomonas suberifaciens permitted the identification of restriction fragment length polymorphism ( rflp ) and single nucleotide polymorphism ( snp ) markers linked to the recessive resistance gene cor .
pcr-based markers were identified by bulked segregant analysis ( bsa ) .
allele-specific primers were generally designed with the 3´ terminal base coinciding with an snp , matching one of the alleles and mismatching the other , and with an additional subterminal 3´ base mismatching both alleles .
codominant , robust , and inexpensive molecular markers were obtained that used standardized pcr conditions .
some of the markers could be analyzed in multiple lactuca mapping populations that did not segregate for disease resistance allowing the cor locus to be located on several maps .
the consistent low density of markers around cor in these maps suggests that cor may be in an area with an elevated rate of recombination .
evaluation of these markers in a large sample of cultivars and landraces identified pairs of flanking polymorphic markers that can be used for marker-assisted selection of corky root resistance .
full scale concrete-filled carbon composite columns without longitudinal and transverse reinforcing steels are tested to investigate the lateral behavior of columns confined with carbon composite tubes .
in the present study , the full-scale circular and square concrete-filled carbon composite tubes ( cfcts ) with various winding angles with respect to longitudinal axes of the tubes are subjected to lateral loads under a constant axial load .
the influence of thickness and winding angle of carbon tubes on the lateral behavior of concrete columns is studied both experimentally and analytically , demonstrating that the calculated ultimate moment capacity of confined columns compares well with test data .
for this analytical process , stressâstrain relationships of confined concrete columns uncovered by the authors are used to identify the distribution of confined compressive concrete strength at failure .
this stressâstrain model considers the influence of winding orientation of carbon fibers on the confining capability of the concrete core .
in this study , the electrokinetics-generated pore fluid transport in an offshore calcareous soil is investigated in three steps .
the pore fluid of the soil specimen tested has a salinity equivalent to that of seawater ( artificial or a-seawater ) .
the electroosmotic flow rates are measured for the a-seawater and two stabilizing permeating solutions , i.e. , 15 % cacl2 and 10 % al2(so4)3·18h2o solutions .
the results also show the significant role of electromigration in transporting the cations in the permeating solutions from the anode to the cathode .
the influence of pore fluid ph on the zeta potential of the soil is also investigated .
the study provides important information for the use of electrokinetics to facilitate in situ artificial cementation of calcareous soils for offshore foundation applications .
although bridges were among the first civil engineering structures to use structural health monitoring ( shm ) technologies , research is now expanding to explore other types of applications , including manitoba &apos;s famous golden boy statue .
global research is identifying the value of using shm technologies for civil engineering applications .
structural health monitoring uses a variety of sensors to gather information about the behavior of a structure .
the information creates a valuable knowledge base that can be analyzed to help identify potential structural risks , develop safer and more efficient new structures , and determine more effective ways to rehabilitate existing structures .
this paper briefly describes the history of the manitoba legislative building and the golden boy and also the use of shm technologies to help preserve the golden boy statue , an icon of provincial heritage .
the angular distribution function for î³d &#91; image &#93; ï0d scattering is calculated .
in southern pines of the united states , resistance to attack by southern pine beetle , dendroctonus frontalis zimmermann , is believed to principally involve flow of oleoresin to beetle attack sites .
both environmental and genetic factors are known to affect the quantity of oleoresin flow in loblolly pine , pinus taeda l. , but little is known about the genetic contribution to phenotypic variation in this trait .
heer we report estimates of genetic variation in oleoresin flow and growth traits for a population of this species .
oleoresin yield , total height , and diameter were measured on 10- and 11-year-old trees from an experimental test in santa rosa county , florida .
trees were from 72 full-sib families produced by mating 48 parents according to a disconnected partial diallel mating design .
resin yield was determined from breast-height samples collected at two times : once in the summer of 1999 when latewood was being produced ( summer resin flow ) , and once in the spring of 2000 during earlywood formation ( spring resin flow ) .
all traits studied were found to be highly genetically variable and to have much greater additive than dominance variance .
estimates of narrow-sense heritability for spring and summer resin flow were in the moderate range and are comparable to values obtained for the growth traits .
additive genetic correlations between oleoresin yield and the growth traits were positive and moderately high , suggesting that directional selection to improve growth in loblolly pine will also result in increased production of oleoresin .
we have developed extensions of traditional distance-dependent , spatial competition analyses that estimate the magnitude of the competitive effects of neighboring trees on target tree growth as a function of the species , size , and distance to neighboring trees .
our analyses also estimate inter- and intra-specific competition coefficients and explicitly partition the competitive effects of neighbors into the effects of shading versus crowding .
we tested the method using data from forests of northern , interior british columbia dominated by western hemlock ( tsuga heterophylla ( raf . )
sarg. ) and western redcedar ( thuja plicata donn ex d. don ) .
for both species , the most parsimonious regression models included terms for the effects of tree size , crowding , and shading and separate competitive effects of four different groups of competing species .
the models explained 33%59 % of the variation in radial growth of the two species .
for both species , growth declined more steeply as a function of crowding than shading .
there was striking asymmetry in the strength of interspecific competition between hemlock and redcedar , with crowding by hemlock having a strong per capita effect on redcedar , while crowding by redcedar had relatively little effect on the radial growth of hemlock .
the variant phenotype displays an unstable feminization of male organs in both male and female flowers .
this result hampers at the moment the direct use of msap markers for the early detection of variants , even though valuable information on putative target sequences will be obtained from a further characterization of these polymorphic markers .
of the eleven species described under the genus decaisnella , none match d. formosa , which is described here as a new species .
we evaluated the effectiveness of 4-allylanisole ( 4aa ) as a protective treatment for loblolly pines threatened by the southern pine beetle , dendroctonus frontalis zimmermann .
three products were evaluated in combination with two methods that promoted attack of trees by d. frontalis .
in trees with increased susceptibility , mortality ranged from 63 % ( untreated ) to 77 % ( 4aa applied in paintball formulation ) , and two products appeared to alter the relative composition of scolytid species that attacked at two heights ; however , tree mortality was unaffected .
in trees challenged with semiochemical attractants , mortality ranged from 54 % ( 4aa released from vials ) to 82 % ( untreated and paintball application of 4aa ) .
although 4aa consistently reduces catch of d. frontalis in traps , it was not efficacious for protecting individual loblolly pines over a period of 30 or 60 days in this experiment .
an a priori power analysis was conducted to aid the design of experiments aimed at estimating the reproductive success of hatchery-born spawners relative to wild-born spawners using parentage assignment .
power was defined as the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis of equal reproductive contributions of hatchery- and wild-born spawners .
a maximum likelihood estimator of relative reproductive success and its variance were derived .
the estimator allowed multiple brood years of data , which was an extension of current approaches .
power increased with stock productivity , initial spawner abundance , fraction of recruits and spawners sampled , and the number of brood years examined .
power decreased with error variance used in the production function .
assuming a fixed total number of spawners , power was a concave-down function of the fraction of hatchery-born spawners .
using nominal values of productivity , error variance , and fraction of hatchery-born spawners , an experiment could achieve 0.8 power if it was run for at least 5 years or if it was applied to a stock with high initial female spawners ( &gt;200 ) and run for at least 2 years .
the objective of this study was to explore the effects of wind-caused sway on the growth and stem hydraulic properties of fire-origin juvenile lodgepole pine ( pinus contorta dougl. ex loud. ) stands after thinning .
nine plots were thinned and trees were treated to suppress or exacerbate sway from the wind : thinned and supported with a pole ( tp ) , thinned with an added sail ( ts ) , thinned control ( tc ) , and unthinned control ( uc ) .
terminal leader growth , radial increment , and earlywood and latewood widths at breast height were measured for the last six growing seasons .
the specific hydraulic conductivity of stems was measured .
the results showed that thinning increased diameter growth and reduced height growth and slenderness coefficient ( particularly for trees with added sails ) compared with the unthinned control .
trees from thinned stands had reduced specific conductivity compared with the trees from unthinned controls , suggesting that tree bending caused functional damage to sapwood .
the number and distribution of the 18s28s and 5s rrna ( rdna ) gene sequences were examined on mitotic chromosomes of six sturgeon species by two-color in situ hybridization .
for of the six species , huso huso , acipenser stellatus , acipenser sturio , and acipenser ruthenus , with about 120 chromosomes , showed from six to eight 18s28s rdna signals , while 5s rdna signals were on only one chromosome pair .
the two species with 250270 chromosomes , acipenser baerii and acipenser transmontanus , showed from 10 to 12 18s28s sites and two chromosome pairs bearing 5s rdna signals .
in all examined species , the rather intense 5s rdna signals apparently overlapped those of 18s28s rdna .
the close association between the two rdna families in species belonging to an ancestral fish order , such as acipenseriformes , supports the hypothesis that the association represents a primitive condition .
the increased soil cohesion or reinforcement provided by roots varies among plant species and soil types .
this study compared the contribution of paper birch ( betula papyrifera marsh. ) and lodgepole pine ( pinus contorta dougl. ex loud. var. latifolia engelm. ) roots to soil shear resistance in two controlled environment experiments .
roots of paper birch and lodgepole pine trees contributed to a significant increase in soil shear resistance , regardless of soil type .
at a shear depth of 0.20 to 0.44 m , paper birch contributed greater reinforcement than lodgepole pine .
both birch and pine provided the most root reinforcement in coarse-textured soil and the least reinforcement in medium-textured silt soil .
soil texture , porosity , and shear strength may have affected root branching of the two species , which in turn may have affected root reinforcement .
at less than 1 year of age , paper birch trees planted as plugs can substantially increase soil shear strength compared with lodgepole pine in all soil types .
the twin-arginine protein transport ( tat ) system is a remarkable molecular machine dedicated to the translocation of fully folded proteins across energy-transducing membranes .
complex cofactor-containing tat substrates acquire their cofactors prior to export , and substrate proteins actually require to be folded before transport can proceed .
thus , it is very likely that mechanisms exist to prevent wasteful export of immature tat substrates or to curb competition between immature and mature substrates for the transporter .
heer we assess the primary sequence relationships between the accessory proteins implicated in this process during assembly of key respiratory enzymes in the model prokaryote escherichia coli .
for each respiratory enzyme studied , a redox enzyme maturation protein ( remp ) was assigned .
the main finding from this review was the hitherto unexpected link between the tat-linked remp dmsd and the nitrate reductase biosynthetic protein narj .
the evolutionary link between tat transport and cofactor insertion processes is discussed .
various tree heights and ages were combined as input and were alternatively assigned to ( h1 , t1 ) and ( h2 , t2 ) in the models to predict heights .
numerical methods were required because some of the models did not have an inverse function .
an understanding of the reciprocal property of the models would improve their application in growth and yield studies .
aspen produces large numbers of seeds , even though it mainly reproduces asexually with root suckers .
there were altogether 10 blocks , each containing 16 microsites and three treatments ( sowing time , watering , sowing shelter ) replicated twice in each block .
seedlings emerged on 56 % of microsites .
sowing time affected seedling emergence .
both the proportion of microsites with seedlings and the number of seedlings per microsite were lower after first than after second sowing , when the weather was rainier .
watering increased the number of seedlings per microsite , but the proportion of micro sites with at least one seedling was not affected .
sowing shelter had a negative effect on the seedling emergence , especially after second sowing .
the survival of seedlings was low ( 10 % ) and strongly dependent on watering .
the effect of block and its interactions with treatments indicated that seedling emergence and survival depended also on seedbed conditions .
we conclude that sexual reproduction of aspen may occur in nature , but it is rare .
the seeds also maintained their germinability longer than earlier observed .
in the present work , interactions between three lactobacillus strains ( lactobacillus fermentum crl1015 , lactobacillus animalis crl1014 , and lactobacillus fermentum crl1016 ) and chicken small intestinal mucus were determined .
three lactobacilli isolated from chicken and selected by their potentially probiotic properties were able to grow in mucus preparations .
three peaks from gel filtration chromatography of intestinal mucus were obtained .
the popelogan inlier consists mainly of mafic volcanic rocks ( lapilli tuffs and massive to amygdaloidal , plagioclase-phyric flows ) of the middle ordovician goulette brook formation .
pyroclastic rocks include high-mgocrni picritic tuffs ( type i) containing , in some cases , &gt;20 % mgo , and related high-mgo andesitic tuff ( type ii ) .
high-mgo rocks were generated by 3040 % partial melting of an enriched mantle source ; type ii is descended from type i mainly by fractionation of olivine .
mafic flows comprise basaltic andesites ( type iii ) with low trace-element abundances and strongly fractionated , trace-element-enriched andesites ( type iv ) .
types iii and iv represent ~20 and ~10 % partial melts , respectively , of a mantle source similar to that of the pyroclastic rocks , based on similar ratios of high field strength elements ( hfse ) .
unlike types i and ii , petrogenesis of mafic flows involved fractionation of plagioclase and possibly amphibole .
volcanic arc signatures include negative nb and ti anomalies in all basalt types , along with low abundances of hfse .
trace-element abundances are inconsistent with prior depletion in the back arc and require involvement of a mantle plume or subcontinental lithosphere .
the highly magnesian composition of the picrites demands high melting temperatures and rapid transit through the crust , both of which suggest extension of the arc-bearing plate .
compositionally similar rocks in the south pacific are associated with unusual tectono-magmatic settings involving ridge subduction , which may have established the necessary extensional environment .
it is proposed that subduction of a plume-influenced ridge segment could explain the chemistry of the goulette brook volcanic rocks .
we compute the conserved quantities of the four-dimensional kerrnewmande sitter ( knds ) black hole through the use of the counterterm renormalization method , and obtain a generalized smarr formula for the mass as a function of the entropy , the angular momentum , and the electric charge .
the first law of thermodynamics associated to the cosmological horizon of knds is also investigated .
using the minimal number of intrinsic boundary counterterms , we consider the quasilocal thermodynamics of an asymptotic de sitterreissnernordstrom black hole , and find that the temperature is equal to the product of the surface gravity ( divided by 2ï ) and the tolman red-shift factor .
we also perform a quasilocal stability analysis by computing the determinant of hessian matrix of the energy with respect to its thermodynamic variables in both the canonical and the grand-canonical ensembles and obtain a complete set of phase diagrams .
incoherent inelastic neutron-scattering spectra of dna and gelatin samples with different hydration levels were measured with the tosca spectrometer at isis , rutherford appleton laboratory .
by contrast , only 29 % of sequences were conserved between g. max and m. truncatula , and some kilobase-scale rearrangements were also observed .
detailed restriction maps were constructed for 11 contigs from the three highly microsyntenic groups , and these maps suggested that sequence order was highly conserved between g. max duplicates and generally conserved between g. max and m. truncatula .
one instance of homoeologous bac contigs in m. truncatula was also observed and examined in detail .
a sequence similarity search against the arabidopsis thaliana genome sequence identified up to three microsyntenic regions in a. thaliana for each of two of the legume bac contig groups .
together , these results confirm previous predictions of one recent genome-wide duplication in g. max and suggest that m. truncatula also experienced ancient large-scale genome duplications .
with 210 genera and 2010 species , cyprinidae is the largest freshwater fish family in the world .
several papers , based on morphological and molecular data , have been published and have led to some solid conclusions , such as the close relationships between north american phoxinins and european leuciscins .
after alignment , there were 1051 sites .
the comparison between pairwise substitutions and hky distances showed that the mtdna control region was suitable for phylogenetic study .
phylogenetic analysis indicated that there are two principal lineages in cyprinidae : cyprinine and leuciscine .
in cyprinine , the relationships could be a basal labeoinae , an intermediate cyprininae , and a diversified barbinae ( including schizothroaxinae ) .
in leuciscine , rasborinae is at the basal position ; gobioninae and leuciscinae are sister groups ; the east asian cultrinâxenocyprinin taxa form a large mono phyl etic group with some small affiliated groups ; and the positions of acheilognathinae and tincinae are still uncertain .
intraspecific interactions may limit population growth of small cladoceran taxa under food-rich , hypertrophic conditions .
multiple-regression models significantly explained a large proportion of the variation in the body size adjusted fecundity and population growth rate of crustacean zooplankton taxa in a shallow , hypertrophic lake .
the results of partial correlation analyses suggested exploitative competition to have only limited significance in determining the zooplankton dynamics .
most of these relationships cannot be explained by food shortage or predation and suggest alternative mechanisms such as chemically mediated , intraspecific interference competition or life history shifts .
the touquoy zone deposit is host to disseminated gold mineralisation in metasiltstones of lower palaeozoic age .
from the close correlation between ore grades and the intersection of favorable stratigraphy and bounding faults , it is apparent that mineralisation is controlled by both structural and lithological influences .
within the ore zone , disseminated gold , arsenopyrite , pyrite , and rare base-metal sulfides are associated with a network of widely spaced , millimeter-scale , quartzcarbonate veinlets .
quasi-pervasive fluid flow and prolonged interaction with the host rocks resulted in a diffuse , but pronounced halo of wall-rock alteration that is characterized by the breakdown of detrital feldspar and metamorphic chlorite and the development of hydrothermal carbonate phases , k-mica , and disseminated sulfides .
these mineralogical changes are accompanied by enrichment in co2 , k , au , as , and s and depletion in na across the ore zone .
the closure of a flow control mechanism at the end of a penstock may cause significant transient pressures .
the governing equations of this unsteady flow phenomenon , the conservation of mass and conservation of momentum , are solved by the method of characteristics using various computational schemes .
a study was carried out to compare the computational results of the transient pressures with measured prototype data for the çatalan power plant in turkey .
prototype data were collected during the closure of the wicket gates of a francis turbine from the test procedures of &quot; load rejection &quot; , &quot; emergency shut down &quot; , and &quot; quick stop &quot; .
the numerical results for the transient pressures just upstream of the turbine are compared with the measured data .
the general agreement between the theoretical and experimental results is found to be quite reasonable .
collagen , particularly type i , and its related derivatives have been extensively employed in many areas of pharmacology .
the present study was performed to determine the safety of collagenpolyvinylpyrrolidone ( collagenpvp ) by in vitro and in vivo studies .
sera and peripheral blood cells from healthy donors without treatment and patients treated with collagenpvp were evaluated .
we observed that the biodrug does not stimulate lymphoproliferation or dna damage in vitro , nor does it induce human anti-porcine type i collagen or anti-collagenpvp antibodies in vivo .
furthermore , no hepatic or renal metabolic dysfunctions were observed when collagenpvp was administered by intradermal or intramuscular routes in short- or long-term treatments .
in conclusion , the present work shows that no cellular damage or immunological adverse effects ( cellular and humoral ) occurred during collagenpvp treatment , even after more than 400 weeks of consecutive administrations .
there are scarce data connecting water relations in azospirillum-inoculated wheat suffering drought during anthesis with the yield and mineral content of grains .
azospirillum brasilense sp245-inoculated seeds of triticum aestivum &apos; pro inta oasis &apos; were sown in nonirrigated and control plots .
water potential , water content , and relative water content were determined on flag leaves .
plant water status was calculated from pressurevolume curves .
at maturity , grain yield and its components were determined .
grain yield loss to drought was 26.5 % and 14.1 % in noninoculated and azospirillum-inoculated plants , respectively .
grain mg and k diminished in nonirrigated , noninoculated plots .
however , grains harvested from azospirillum-inoculated plants had significantly higher mg , k , and ca than noninoculated plants .
the growth response of the biocontrol agent pantoea agglomerans to changes in water activity ( aw ) , temperature , and ph was determined in vitro in nutrient yeast extract-sucrose medium .
the minimum temperature at which p. agglomerans was able to grow was 267272 kelvins ( 6 to 1°c ) , and growth of p. agglomerans did not change at varying ph levels ( 4.58.6 ) .
the minimum aw for growth was 0.96 in media modified with glycerol and 0.95 in media modified with nacl or glucose .
solute used to reduce water activity had a great influence on bacterial growth , especially at unfavorable conditions ( e.g. , low ph or temperature ) .
nacl stimulated bacterial growth under optimum temperatures but inhibited it under unfavorable ph conditions ( 4.5 or 8.6 ) .
in contrast , the presence of glucose in the medium allowed p. agglomerans to grow over a broad range of temperature ( 342°c ) or ph ( 58.6 ) regimes .
this study has defined the range of environmental conditions ( aw , ph , and temperature ) over which the bacteria may be developed for biological control of postharvest diseases .
exotoxin a ( eta ) production in pseudomonas aeruginosa requires the regulatory locus regab .
pseudomonas aeruginosa pa103 produces significantly higher levels of eta than the prototypic strain pao1 does , partly because of differences in the regab locus .
other factors that contribute to this variation are not known .
we previously described the p. aeruginosa gene ptxr that positively regulates production of eta through regab .
eta production was enhanced but still iron regulated in the pao1 strain pao1-xr that carries two copies of ptxr on its chromosome .
heer we determine whether ptxr regulation of eta is different in pa103 .
in contrast to pao1-xr , eta activity produced by pa103-2r , a pa103 strain carrying two copies of ptxr , is enhanced tenfold and partially deregulated in the presence of iron .
real-time pcr transcriptional analysis showed that the copy number of toxa mrna in pa103-2r is significantly higher than in pa103 in both the presence and absence of iron , yet no similar increase in either regab or ptxr mrna copy number was detected .
the integrated plasmid together with adjoining dna was retrieved from the pa103-2r chromosome to determine whether integration-induced dna changes played a role in this phenotype .
introduction of the retrieved plasmid in pa103 produced a phenotype similar to that of pa103-2r .
sequence analysis of the plasmid revealed the loss of 322 bp within the region 3 &apos; of ptxr .
a plasmid construct carrying a 4-bp insertion in this same region produced in pa103 a phenotype similar to that of pa103-2r .
our results suggest that the effect of ptxr on toxa expression is different in pa103 than in pao1 and that this variation in pa103-2r does not occur solely through regab .
changes within the region 3 &apos; of ptxr are critical for the production of the unique pa103-2r phenotype , which occurs in trans and requires intact ptxr , but is not caused by ptxr overexpression .
the needle falls shear zone is a major paleoproterozoic discontinuity separating an archean craton from accreted paleoproterozoic terranes in the western trans-hudson orogen .
it is a 1 km-wide subvertical mylonite zone forming the southwestern sector of a northeast-trending shear system extending for more than 400 km. kinematic data indicate oblique , east-side-up dextral strike-slip displacement throughout its evolution from ductile through late brittle deformation .
for most of its exposed length , it marks the northwestern margin of the wathaman batholith .
the oldest pb-evaporation ages of zircons from mylonite average 1857 ma , consistent with published zircon ages of the wathaman batholith , confirming the batholith is protolith for much of the shear zone .
the synkinematic metamorphic assemblage of amphibolebiotitequartzfeldspar signifies deformation under amphibolite-facies conditions ( 500630°c ) .
the timing of ductile deformation cannot be well constrained , but occurred after emplacement of the wathaman batholith at 1857 ma and prior to cooling of amphibole below its ar blocking temperature at 1780 ma.
enhancers are regulatory dna sequences that can work over a large distance .
efficient enhancer action over a distance clearly requires special mechanisms for facilitating communication between the enhancer and its target .
while the chromatin looping model can explain the majority of the observations , some recent experimental findings suggest that a chromatin scanning mechanism is used to establish the loop .
these new findings help to understand the mechanism of action of the elements that can prevent enhancerpromoter communication ( insulators ) .
a protocol for isolating and regenerating protoplasts from trichothecium roseum has been described .
a maximum number of 28 × 104 protoplasts/ml were obtained at ph 5.5 .
the rates of reaction of muonium atoms with solutes , ionic and organic , were studied in solvents of wildly differing polarities ( water , methanol , and hexane ) and their rate constants were compared , where possible .
in these reactions  which are those of a highly reactive atom , an isotope of hydrogen  it transpires that the reaction rates are higher in solvents in which the solute is more soluble and muonium diffuses faster .
this study leads to various kinetic-solvent-effect ratios and to the observation of the reaction of muonium with free radicals being among the fastest reactions recorded so far between two neutral species in solution .
for molecular and cytogenetic studies , two partial bacterial artificial chromosome ( bac ) libraries of the garlic cultivar allium sativum l. &apos; danyang &apos; were constructed using high molecular weight ( hmw ) garlic dna , the pbac1sacb1 vector , and the pindigobac536 vector .
the average insert size of the bac library was about 90 kb. the sequence compositions of the bac clones were characterized by southern hybridization with garlic genomic dna and a repetitive sequence clone of garlic .
two bac clones with weak signals ( thus implying mostly unique sequences ) , gbc2-5e and gbc2-4d , were selected for fish analysis .
fish analysis localized the gbc2-5e ( ~100 kb ) bac clone on the long arm of garlic chromosome 7 .
the other bac clone , gbc2-4d ( ~110 kb ) , gave rise to discrete fish signals on a mid-size early metaphase chromosome .
the fish screening with bac clones proved to be a useful resource for molecular cytogenetic studies of garlic , and will be useful for further mapping and sequencing studies of important genes of this plant .
woody debris is recognized as an important structural component in forests , but little is known about the epixylic communities that it supports in many forest types .
the goal of this study was to identify the macrofungal ( asco mycetes and basidiomycetes ) and myxomycete communities found on woody debris in the topographically dissected mixed-oak forests of southern ohio and identify environmental parameters that influence species richness and species distributions .
fifty oak ( quercus spp .
l. ) logs were selected across slope aspects and slope positions throughout the landscape to maximize microsite variability .
over a 2-year period , 130 epixylic species were collected ( 28 ascomy cetes , 72 basidiomycetes , and 30 myxomycetes ) .
log surface area explained a significant amount of variation in species richness ( r2 = 0.51 , p &lt; 0.001 ) .
richness was significantly ( p &lt; 0.05 ) correlated with volume of woody debris in the plot ( + ) and with study log volume ( + ) , lichen cover (  ) , and surface structural characteristics ( amount of bark ( + ) , solid wood (  ) , and fragmented wood ( + ) ) .
canonical correspondence analysis revealed that slope aspect , bark cover , percent slope , and woody stem density influenced individual epixylic species distributions .
because of their influence on epixylic communities , various environmental parameters must be accounted for in regional epixylic studies .
a new linkage map of cucumis melo , derived from the f2 progeny of a cross between pi 414723 and c. melo &apos; topmark &apos; is presented .
the map spans a total of 1421 cm and includes 179 points consisting of random amplified polymorphic dna ( rapd ) , amplified fragment length polymorphism ( aflp ) , inter-simple sequence repeats ( issrs ) , simple sequence repeats ( ssrs ) , and restriction fragment length polymorphism ( rflp ) markers .
the map also includes an aphid resistance trait ( vat ) and the sex type gene , andromonoecious (a) , the two of which are important in resistance breeding and the control of hybrid seed production , as well as a seed-color gene , wt-2 .
a sub-set of our ssr and rflp markers were also mapped , as part of this study , on additional mapping populations that were published for this species .
flowing waters may represent a force that structures the locomotor capacity of stream fishes .
we used a modified critical swimming speed ( ucrit ) procedure to investigate the relationship between base-flow conditions and locomotor performance of blacknose dace ( rhinichthys atratulus ) from five sites within three watersheds of baltimore county , maryland .
our modified test used 5-min intervals between incremental increases of 5 cm·s1 in swim-tunnel current velocity .
this time increment represented a realistic transit time across riffles found in the home streams of dace .
to characterize current velocity conditions of the streams , we measured current velocity at 55 evenly spaced points per site during base-flow conditions .
swimming performance varied greatly among 32 individual fish from the five sites ( 55ucrit from 26.33 to 69.00 cm·s1 ) and was positively correlated ( r2 = 0.38 , p = 0.002 ) with mean base-flow current velocities at the site of collection .
additionally , among fish from the site with the widest and most even distribution of current velocities ( from 0 to 54 cm·s1 ) , we observed the largest range of swimming performances .
our results suggest that variation in flow conditions among streams influences swimming ability of blacknose dace and can result in heretofore-unappreciated intraspecific variation in swimming performance .
we introduce and review the consistent ( decoherent ) histories approach to quantum mechanics due to griffiths , to gell-mann and hartle , and to omnes .
we will not attempt an in depth look at this approach as it would be impossible to treat it in such a short review .
the emphasis is on understanding the broader meaning of the consistency and decoherence .
the consistent history approach to quantum mechanics provides a precise conceptual framework for describing how a closed quantum system develops in time .
the approach also provides a framework from which we may observe the emergence of an approximately classical domain for macroscopic systems , together with the conventional copenhagen quantum mechanics for microscopic subsystems .
we will study the formalism of decoherence and look at several approaches to decoherence .
in examining a system of quantum brownian motion and using the methods of feynman and vernon , we derive an equation of motion for the density matrix , the master equation of the system .
a method for assessing landslide hazard under combined loading is described .
the loads are considered as pulses that occur randomly in time .
the method accounts for the rate of occurrence and the duration of the loads and calculates the rate of coincidence of two or more loads .
this is used to calculate the failure probability , which is equal to the probability that the load combination will exceed a threshold value during a given time period .
the method was applied to a site in the cascade mountains of washington .
the example demonstrates a rational approach that accounts for the properties of the loads and the different loading conditions that may be expected .
tailings pond water produced from the extraction of bitumen from the oil sands in northern alberta , canada , was treated using the spray freezing process .
the wastewater was frozen by spraying at 10°c and 24°c ambient temperatures .
the effect of the degree of freezing ( i.e. , freezing with and without runoff generation ) of the sprayed water on the treatment efficiency , the concentration , and distribution of the impurities within the ice columns was examined .
when the sprayed water only partially froze ( i.e. , freezing with runoff formation ) , the treatment efficiency ( measured by reduction in cod , toc , conductivity , cl , so42 concentrations ) was higher and larger volumes of high quality meltwater was obtained .
reduction of toxicity ( microtox ) in meltwater , and the relationship between the overall impurity removal and toxicity reduction was also examined in this study .
the decay coefficients were determined for prediction of meltwater impurity concentrations using mathematical models .
three-year-old coastal douglas-fir ( pseudotsuga menziesii ( mirb . )
franco ) seedlings were planted in a factorial experiment with three levels of shading ( 0 , 30 , and 60 % ) , three levels of mechanical stimulus ( staked , freestanding , and bent ) , and two levels of nitrogen fertilization ( 0 and 200 kg/ha ) to investigate the separate and combined effects of these factors on morphology and bending resistance .
fertilization increased branch angle and increased the sensitivity of branch and leader extension to bending stresses but did not affect volume increment , stem form , or bending resistance .
the effects of shading and mechanical treatments on morphology were independent and additive .
shading reduced stem diameter and volume increment , but did not affect height increment , producing more slender trees .
bending produced less slender trees through a combination of reduced height increment and increased diameter increment .
staking did not affect tree morphology .
these results point towards the biological basis for the development of tree instability in high density stands .
headwater streams , varying in flow persistence from ephemeral to intermittent to perennial , provide the tightest coupling between water and land , yet they often receive the least protection during forest management .
we described communities of aquatic insects in perennial , intermittent , and ephemeral channels surrounded by old-growth forest and 4- to 8-year-old clearcuts in clayoquot sound , british columbia , to determine whether temporary streams have unique aquatic communities and to examine the short-term impacts of harvesting .
we measured flow persistence , stream size , canopy cover , organic detritus , and algal biomass in 19 streams .
we sampled aquatic invertebrates with a combination of emergence cages and kicknet samples .
temporary and old-growth streams had more organic detritus and a higher abundance of shredders .
perennial and clearcut streams had a higher abundance of some algal grazers , but not higher algal biomass .
insect richness was similar in intermittent and perennial streams of each seral stage but lower in ephemeral streams .
intermittent streams contained four taxa not found in the other stream classes ; perennial and ephemeral streams had none .
communities of aquatic insects differed between streams surrounded by clearcuts and old growth , and varied with continuity of flow .
we sequenced the complete mitochondrial control regions of 11 red knots ( calidris canutus ) .
the control region is 1168 bp in length and is flanked by trna glutamate ( glu ) and the gene nd6 at its 5 &apos; end and trna phenylalanine ( phe ) and the gene 12s on its 3 &apos; end .
the sequence possesses conserved sequence blocks f , e , d , c , csb-1 , and the bird similarity box ( bsb ) , as expected for a mitochondrial copy .
flanking trna regions show correct secondary structure , and a relative rate test indicated no significant difference between substitution rates in the sequence we obtained versus the known mitochondrial sequence of turnstones ( charadriiformes : scolopacidae ) .
these characteristics indicate that the sequence is mitochondrial in origin .
to confirm this , we sequenced the control region of a single individual using both purified mitochondrial dna and genomic dna .
the sequences were identical using both methods .
the sequence and methods presented in this paper may now serve as a reference for future studies using knot and other avian control regions .
furthermore , the discovery of five variable sites in 11 knots towards the 3 &apos; end of the control region , and the variability of this region in contrast to the more conserved central domain in the alignment between knots and other charadriiformes , highlights the importance of this area as a source of variation for future studies in knots and other birds .
forest soil disturbance intervals are usually too long to measure using plot-based studies , and thus they are poorly understood .
the mean soil disturbance interval ( msdi ) in an old-growth forest on the west coast of vancouver island was estimated from radiocarbon dates of charcoal from organic and mineral soil horizons .
two assumptions are required to estimate the msdi : (1) charcoal from forest fires is deposited within the organic horizon and eventually mixed into deeper mineral horizons by soil disturbances , and (2) the probability of soil disturbance is spatially homogeneous and affected only by the time since the last fire or the last soil disturbance .
the msdi is then estimated by the rate at which the proportion of undisturbed sample sites ( determined by the proportion of sites with charcoal from the most recent fire in the organic horizon ) decreases with increasing time since the last fire .
soil charcoal evidence of time since fire was determined at 83 sites using 141 radiocarbon dates .
the estimated msdi was greater on slopes ( ca. 2010 years ) than on terraces ( ca. 920 years ) .
the long periods between soil disturbances , especially on slopes , are consistent with other evidence from the study area that suggests infrequent tree uprooting is the predominant mode of soil disturbance .
the effects of b-cyclodextrin ( bcd ) inclusion complexation on the ability of violacein to prevent gastric ulceration in mice were studied .
violaceinbcd inclusion complexes were prepared in 1:1 and 1:2 molar ratios and analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry and powder x-ray diffractometry .
violacein previously administered orally at 10 mg/kg significantly reduced indomethacin-induced gastric lesions , as well as 100 mg/kg of cimetidine ( positive control ) .
however , bcd complexation in both molar ratios significantly potentiated the protective action of violacein .
in the hclethanol-induced gastric ulcer model , violacein and the 1:2 inclusion complex ( 10 mg/kg , p.o. ) inhibited gastric damage by almost 85 % , whereas a 63 % reduction was observed for the positive control , lansoprazole , at 30 mg/kg .
in contrast , treatment with the 1:1 inclusion complex resulted in almost total disappearance of the antiulcer activity in this model .
no significant changes in stress-induced gastric injury were found .
in addition , the 1:2 inclusion complex improved the antilipoperoxidant activity of violacein in rat liver cells exposed to t-butyl hydroperoxide , whereas the 1:1 complex was less active than violacein .
in summary , the 1:2 bcd inclusion complex has gastroprotective properties similar to or higher than that of violacein .
an increase in mucosal defensive mechanisms and protection against peroxidative damage might be involved .
photoluminescent cdscdse nanocomposites with coreshell structures were obtained via a novel two-step g-irradiation process followed by a simple ion-exchange reaction at room temperature and under ambient pressure .
site preparation alleviates the effects of pinegrass ( calamagrostis rubescens buckl. ) interference on conifers in british columbia , but little is known about interference mechanisms and appropriate site preparation methods for steep slopes .
in this study , lodgepole pine ( pinus contorta dougl. ex loud. ) was planted in pinegrass controls and small ( 90 × 90 cm ) and large ( 180 × 90 cm ) patches where (i) only pinegrass was removed using glyphosate or ( ii ) both pinegrass and the forest floor were removed using an excavator .
treatments were replicated three times in east- and west-facing clearcuts and effects were followed for 9 years .
two-year pine survival was 78 % in the control and &gt;97 % in large patches .
all patch treatments improved pine growth , but it was greatest in large chemical patches during the initial 6 years and in both large patch treatments thereafter .
removal of the forest floor reduced foliar and soil nutrients , increased bulk density and soil water availability , decreased porosity and aggregate stability , and reduced ectomycorrhizal diversity and richness .
these changes were not observed in chemical patches .
all patch treatments increased soil temperatures and reduced frost relative to controls , but more so in large patches .
pinegrass can suppress early pine performance , and large chemical patches that retain the forest floor are best for relieving the multiple environmental stressors .
dna polymorphism in the ditylenchus dipsaci complex was investigated using amplified fragment length polymorphism ( aflp ) to determine the relationships among populations growing mainly on vicia faba and to develop diagnostic markers .
twenty-two populations of d. dipsaci originating from different geographical areas and one population of ditylenchus myceliophagus were used .
aflp proved to be a powerful method to reveal intraspecific polymorphism even within the giant type .
the analysis showed a clear distinction between the giant and normal populations , with genetic distances similar to those observed between normal populations and d. myceliophagus or giant populations and d. myceliophagus , strengthening the hypothesis that these two nematode types could be considered distinct species .
two specific aflp markers differentiating the two types were converted into sequenced characterized amplified region ( scar ) markers .
used in a multiplex pcr , the scar primers proved to be a rapid and efficient tool to identify the giant and the normal types of d. dipsaci .
freeze tolerance exists among a few species of terrestrially hibernating north american frogs such as the wood frog ( rana sylvatica ) and the spring peeper ( pseudacris crucifer ) .
we investigated jump distance and swimming speed of these two frog species during postfreeze recovery because impaired performance , even if reversible , could have adverse ecological consequences for these frogs .
following a nonlethal freeze at â1.5 °c , r. sylvatica returned to the prefreeze level of both modes of locomotion sooner than p. crucifer ( 54 h vs. 11 d or longer ) .
wood frogs recovered slowly following more intense freezes : a â4.0 °c treatment group failed to reach the prefreeze level after 11 d , and a â3.0 °c treatment group took 54 h to reach 50 % of the prefreeze level .
as a result of their diminished locomotive performance , frogs recovering from natural freezes may be temporarily less able to exploit environmental resources and less able to escape predators active in winter .
nevertheless , given the massive biochemical and physiological disturbances accompanying tissue freezing , the recovery dynamics in these frogs seem sufficiently rapid to minimize most ecological risks and to permit early spring breeding .
the faster recovery of locomotion in r. sylvatica compared with p. crucifer is consistent , however , with its greater northward distribution .
many red-listed species grow on decaying wood in the boreal forest , and their persistence depends on dispersal to new patches .
to investigate whether substrate quality could affect establishment and distribution of the red-listed moss buxbaumia viridis ( dc ) moug. &amp; nestl. , cultivation experiments as well as a field investigation of wood quality were performed .
spore germination was negatively affected by low ph and phosphorus (p) concentration in cultivation media , while nitrogen (n) concentration did not significantly affect germination .
results from the experiments were supported by the field investigation , where the probability of sporophyte occurrence increased with increasing ph. in addition , the interaction between substrate type ( wood or humus ) and p was significant .
occurrence of sporophytes was not significantly affected by n concentration in the wood .
force at low frequency ( 10 hz ) was also measured at r0 , r1 , r2 , and r3 , and at 15 min of recovery , while force at high frequency ( 100 hz ) was measured only at r0 and r3 and in recovery .
voluntary exercise increased twitch +df/dtmax at r0 following 5 , 20 , 40 , and 60 min of exercise , from 2553 ± 150 n/s at pre to 39 % , 41 % , 42 % , and 36 % above pre , respectively ( p &lt; 0.005 ) .
twitch +df/dtmax decayed at brief rest ( r3 ) following 20 , 40 , and 60 min of exercise ( p &lt; 0.05 ) .
pt at r0 following 5 and 20 min of exercise was above that at pre ( p &lt; 0.05 ) , indicating that during the early phase of moderate- intensity repetitive exercise , potentiation occurs in the relative absence of lff .
at 40 and 60 min of exercise , pt at r0 was unchanged from pre .
the lff ( 10 hz ) induced by the protocol was evident at 40 and 60 min ( r0âr3 ; p &lt; 0.05 ) and at 15 min following exercise ( p &lt; 0.05 ) .
high-frequency force was not significantly compromised by the protocol .
since twitch force was maintained , these results suggest that as exercise progresses , lff develops , which can be compensated for by potentiation .
the wound-associated wood that developed 17 months following artificial xylem injury in eucalyptus globulus ( labill ) and eucalyptus nitens ( maiden ) was examined anatomically and chemically .
this new tissue located immediately adjacent to the wound site and termed &quot; wound wood &quot; was highly variable consisting of callus , altered wood of increased parenchyma density , and dark extractives , visible to the naked eye .
subsequent chemical analysis of crude wound wood extracts by hplc coupled to negative ion electrospray mass spectrometry revealed the presence of a diverse range of polyphenolic compounds including hydrolysable tannins , proanthocyanidins , flavanone glycosides , and formylated phloroglucinol compounds .
a number of polyphenols were unequivocally identified including engelitin , pedunculagin , and tellimagrandin i. other compounds present in wound wood include various hydroxystilbene glycosides and volatile terpenes .
the importance of the diverse range of secondary metabolites detected in wound wood is discussed in relation to tree wound repair responses .
thermophilic bacterium strain c2 , which has the ability to transform crude oils , was isolated from the reservoir of the shengli oil field in east china .
the gram-negative , rod-shaped , nonmotile cells were grown at a high temperature , up to 83 °c , in the neutral to alkaline ph range .
depending on the culture conditions , the organism occurred as single rods or as filamentous aggregates .
strain c2 was grown chemoorganotrophically and produced metabolites , such as volatile fatty acids , 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid , bis(2-ethylhexyl)ester , dibutyl phthalate , and di-n-octyl phthalate .
it could metabolize different organic substrates ( acetate , d-glucose , fructose , glycerol , maltose , pyruvate , starch , sucrose , xylose , hexadecane ) .
the g+c content ( 68 mol % ) and the 16s rrna sequence of strain c2 indicated that the isolate belonged to the genus thermus .
the strain affected different crude oils and changed their physical and chemical properties .
the biochemical interactions between crude oils and strain c2 follow distinct trends characterized by a group of chemical markers ( saturates , aromatics , resins , asphaltenes ) .
those trends show an increase in saturates and a decrease in aromatics , resins , and asphaltenes .
the bioconversion of crude oils leads to an enrichment in lighter hydrocarbons and an overall redistribution of these hydrocarbons .
shock is a condition where blood flow is inadequate for tissue needs .
in all forms of shock , the concentrations of endothelins ( ets ) are elevated , and they are especially high in septic shock .
the rise in ets plasma levels may initially have some positive homeostatic effects , for ets can help restore normal vascular tone .
however , high levels of ets compromise the appropriate matching of flow to tissue needs and contribute to the pathophysiology of shock .
attempts at regulating the effects of ets by the use of pharmacological blockers is made complicated by important interactions between the eta and etb receptors and potentially different effects on different tissues .
we conclude that antagonism of et receptors is unlikely to be helpful for cardiogenic or hemorrhagic shock .
furthermore , selective blockade is unlikely to be helpful .
however , moderate doses of a mixed et receptor antagonist may be of use for the management of septic patients .
in addition , the quantification of edge effects can benefit from the application of complementary spatial analysis methods .
forest floor n mineralization and environmental variables were intensively measured 5 years after harvest along transects crossing the north and south edges of a 1-ha clearcut , in a high-elevation engelmann spruce  subalpine fir forest .
initial no3-n content and net nitrification markedly increased in the opening within 26 m of each edge .
net ammonification did not exhibit obvious edge-related spatial patterns .
spatial patterns of nitrification appeared to be more closely related to spatial changes in substrate quality than to soil temperature and moisture .
results of the wavelet and dei analyses provided quantification of locations and functional extents of edge effects .
red oak species can be difficult to identify , possibly because of extensive interspecific hybridization , although most evidence of this is morphological .
the community included northern red oak ( quercus rubra l. ) , shumard oak ( quercus shumardii buckl. ) , and pin oak ( quercus palustris muenchh. ) .
species were identified using whole-tree silvic characters , the approach most often implemented by foresters .
we found high genetic diversity within species but limited genetic differences between species .
phenetic clustering showed that q. rubra and q. shumardii were more genetically similar than either was to q. palustris , but a neighbor-joining tree revealed that individuals of the different species did not resolve into single-species clusters .
the three largest groups are consistent with the following biological interpretations : (i) pure q. rubra , ( ii ) q. rubra , q. shumardii , and their hybrids , and ( iii ) q. rubra , q. shumardii , q. palustris , and their hybrids .
a new numerical method for solving the integro-differential equations that appear in the theory of atomic scattering is devised .
in this paper , the analytical and experimental results of tests on a benchmark and a damaged circular bridge column are presented .
the benchmark column is a 40 % scale reinforced concrete circular bridge column damaged as a result of shear failure during a cyclic-loading test ; the benchmark column was then repaired by epoxy and non-shrinkage mortar and rehabilitated by carbon fiber reinforced plastic ( cfrp ) after the cyclic-loading test .
the benchmark bridge column is tested under a cyclic-loading test with constant axial load .
the result shows that the column suffered shear failure at low displacement ductility .
non-shrinkage mortar with high-pressure epoxy injection was used to repair the damaged bridge column , and then three-layer cfrp was used to rehabilitate the shear strength of the bridge column .
the test result shows that the repaired and rehabilitated column develops significantly improved hys ter etic responses at high displacement ductility .
the analytical lateral force  displacement relationship of the bridge columns can accurately predict the experimental result , especially in the nonlinear region .
coyotes ( canis latrans ) in yellowstone national park ( ynp ) have lived in the absence of wolves ( canis lupus ) for over 60 years .
although we documented that wolves killed coyotes , it also became clear that surviving coyotes quickly adjusted their behaviors when wolves were present .
when coyotes were near wolves or in areas of high wolf use , they fed on carcasses much more ; however , they increased the amount of time spent in vigilance activities and decreased rest .
there appears to be a trade-off in which wolf kills provide a quick source of food that is energetically advantageous to coyotes ; however , attendant costs included increased vigilance , decreased rest , and a higher risk of being killed .
changes in the behavior of coyotes in response to the reintroduction of this large carnivore may ultimately have wide-ranging cascading effects throughout the ecosystem .
yield stress values of four thickened ( high-density ) mineral tailings at varying solids concentrations were determined using three different techniques .
the first set of values was measured using the modified slump test approach with an open-ended cylinder having an aspect ratio of 1.2 .
a second set was derived from measurements obtained from a coaxial cylinder fitted to a rheolab® mc1 rheometer .
the results were graphically compared with those obtained using the miniature vane technique , a popular and well-accepted method of measuring yield stress .
empirical relations developed from the modified slump test appear to predict reasonably accurate yield stress values up to about 200 pa when compared with the vane and rheometer results .
it is concluded that , although the time-dependent nature of the tailings tested may induce errors as much as ±30 % for some samples , the modified slump test provides a reliable and simple test for evaluating the yield stress of thickened tailings .
the method can therefore be employed as a first approximation of the changing parameters of high-density thickened tailings in the field without necessarily resorting to sophisticated equipment .
proboscipedia ( pb ) is a hox protein required for adult maxillary palp and proboscis formation .
to identify domains of pb important for function , 21 pb point mutant alleles were sequenced .
twelve pb alleles had dna sequence changes that encode an altered pb protein product .
the phenotypic analysis of the pb homeobox missense alleles suggests that the pb hd is required for maxillary palp and proboscis development and pb â sex combs reduced ( scr ) genetic interaction .
the phenotypic analysis of the pb nonsense or frameshift alleles suggests that the c-terminus is an important region required for maxillary palp and proboscis development and pbâscr genetic interaction .
pb and scr do not interact directly with one another in a co-immunoprecipitation assay and in a yeast two-hybrid analysis , which suggests the pbâscr genetic interaction is not mediated by a direct interaction between pb and scr .
during the transition from a slow to rapid depolarization rhythm , rate-dependent sodium channel blockade develops progressively and increases from beat to beat under procainamide but more abruptly under lidocaine .
procainamide caused a greater reduction in &bar;dv/dtmax&bar; than did lidocaine in the responses to basic stimulation , and it favored the occurrence of cycle length prolongation at tachycardia onset as the &bar;dv/dtmax&bar; decreased progressively in successive beats .
this resulted in conduction block and tachycardia termination in three of eight preparations .
this study supports the notion that cycle length dynamics at tachycardia onset are determined by the properties of the reentrant substrate and their pharmacological modulation .
the paper compares the mobile5a , mobile6 , virginia tech microscopic energy and emission model ( vt-micro ) , and comprehensive modal emissions model ( cmem ) models for estimating hot-stabilized , light-duty vehicle emissions .
specifically , carbon monoxide ( co ) emissions exhibit abrupt changes at low speeds and high acceleration levels and constant emissions at negative acceleration levels .
the vt-micro model appears to be accurate in estimating hot-stabilized , light-duty , normal vehicle tailpipe emissions .
specifically , the emission estimates of the vt-micro and mobile6 models are consistent in trends with laboratory measurements .
furthermore , the vt-micro and mobile6 models accurately capture emission increases for aggressive acceleration drive cycles in comparison with other drive cycles .
for boreal mixedwood stands burned by the 1999 black river wildfire in southeastern manitoba were sampled to determine the effect of fire severity on density and diameter and height growth of trembling aspen ( populus tremuloides michx. ) suckers during the first three postfire years .
analysis of covariance , using prefire aspen basal area as the covariate , indicated that fire severity significantly affected postfire aspen sucker density , with significantly lower density found on severely burned plots .
changes in aspen sucker density over the three postfire years depended on fire severity , with significant changes observed only on scorched and lightly burned plots .
sucker mortality was positively related to the initial sucker density , with more than 80 % of the total variance being explained .
fire severity significantly affected the growth of dominant aspen suckers in the first , but not the second and the third , postfire years .
the first year of growth initially increased and then remained stable with the increase in density , while the second and third years of growth were not affected by density .
since fire severity within and ( or ) among burned stands is inherently heterogeneous , the effect of fire severity must be taken into account in predicting postfire density and growth of aspen suckers .
the present study examined the effects of chronic activation of 5&apos;-amp-activated protein kinase ( ampk ) on the oxidative capacity and myosin heavy chain ( mhc ) based fiber phenotype of rodent fast- and slow-twitch muscles .
spragueâdawley rats received daily injections for 4 weeks of the known ampk activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-î²-d-ribofuranoside ( aicar ) or vehicle ( control ) .
the aicar group displayed increases in hexokinase-ii ( hxk-ii ) activity , expression , and phosphorylation in fast-twitch muscles ( p &lt; 0.001 ) but not in the slow-twitch soleus ( sol ) .
in the aicar group , citrate synthase ( ec 4.1.3.7 ) and 3-hydroxyacyl-coa-dehydrogenase ( ec 1.1.1.35 ) were elevated 1.6- and 2.1-fold ( p &lt; 0.05 ) , respectively , in fast-twitch medial gastrocnemius ( mg ) , and by 1.2- and 1.4-fold ( p &lt; 0.05 ) in the slower-twitch plantaris ( plant ) .
no changes were observed in the slow-twitch sol .
in contrast , the activity of glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase ( ec 1.2.1.12 ) remained unchanged in all muscles .
aicar treatment did not alter the mhc-based fiber type composition in fast- or slow-twitch muscles , as determined by immunohistochemical and electrophoretic analytical methods or by rtâpcr .
we conclude that chronic activation of ampk mimics the metabolic changes associated with chronic exercise training ( increased oxidative capacity ) in the fast-twitch mg and plant , but does not coordinately alter mhc isoform content or mrna expression .
fishers in larger groups also experienced lower search times from 1993 to 1995 .
sugar maple ( acer saccharum marsh. ) trees exhibit seasonal patterns of production , accumulation , and utilization of nonstructural carbohydrates that are closely correlated with phenological events and ( or ) physiological processes .
the simultaneous seasonal patterns of both reserve and soluble carbohydrates in the leaves , twigs , branches , and trunks of healthy mature sugar maple trees were characterized .
the concentrations of starch and soluble sugars ( sucrose , glucose , fructose , xylose , raffinose , and stachyose ) were determined .
starch , the major reserve carbohydrate in sugar maple , is low during the active photosynthetic growth season .
starch is accumulated in the xylem ray tissues in late summer and early fall .
during the cold season , there is a close relationship between starch hydrolysisaccumulation and temperature .
soluble sugars increase when starch concentrations decrease during the cold months , and these sugars may play a role in cold tolerance .
patterns of change in the stem tissues are similar to those in the root tissues but with slight differences in the timing .
effects of cannabinoids on endogenous potassium and calcium currents in hek293 cells were studied using the whole-cell variant of the patch-clamp technique .
the cannabinoid agonists win 55,212-2 , methanandamide , and anandamide ( 1 mm ) decreased the calcium current by 53.1 ± 2.6 , 47.5 ± 1.2 , and 38.8 ± 3.1 % , respectively , after transfection of human cb1 cannabinoid receptor ( hcb1 ) cdna into hek293 cells .
the delayed rectifier-like current was not changed after application of these agonists , but the inward rectifier was increased by 94.0 ± 3.6 , 83.7 ± 5.1 , and 63.0 ± 2.5 % after application of win 55,212-2 , methanandamide , and anandamide , respectively .
the effects of the cannabinoid antagonists ( am251 , am281 , and am630 ) on the inward rectifier and calcium currents were the opposite of those seen with cannabinoid agonists ; thus , these compounds act as inverse agonists in this preparation .
these results suggest that endogenous inward rectifier and calcium currents are modulated by cannabinoids in hek293 cells , and that some expressed receptors may be constitutively active .
the benefits of intelligent transportation systems ( its ) are indirectly represented by the annual world market for its , which according to its canada ( 2002 ) will be $ 90 billion can by 2011 .
improved safety is often cited as the top goal of implementing its .
despite the magnitude of these investments and their underlying goal to improve transportation safety , there are deficiencies in the quantity and quality of reported its safety benefits .
many of the benefits reported to date suffer from poor data , lack of an evaluation framework , and inconsistent terminology used to attribute benefits to its application areas .
this paper explores these issues , while attempting to address one of them , namely the lack of an evaluation framework for assessing the safety benefits of its .
accordingly , a unique framework is developed based on the canadian its architecture .
the framework includes the identification of evaluation metrics that are mapped to the market packages in the canadian its architecture and correlated with each other to capture the &quot; cause &quot; and &quot; effect &quot; flow of benefits .
this framework will benefit future its safety evaluations by providing a structure for undertaking evaluations using terminology consistent with the canadian its architecture .
this paper presents the analysis of a 12 month long field study of the infiltration characteristics of two residual soil slopes in singapore .
the field measurements consist of rainfall data , runoff data of natural and simulated rainfall events , and pore-water pressure changes during infiltration at several depths and at several locations on the two slopes .
the analysis of the field measurements identifies the total rainfall and the initial pore-water pressures within the two slopes as the controlling parameters for the changes in the pore-water pressures within the slopes during infiltration .
the evaluation of cheap carbon sources ( co-substrate ) and process conditions for microbial treatment of domestic wastewater sludge ( dws ) was investigated using a liquid state bioconversion ( lsb ) laboratory scale process .
six cheap carbon sources were used : wheat flour ( wf ) , rice flour ( rf ) , corn flour ( cf ) , sago starch ( ss ) , cassava starch ( cs ) , and commercial sugar (s) .
process conditions such as co-substrate(s) concentration , temperature , initial ph , and inoculum size were optimized in terms of dry filter cake ( dfc ) production , removal of total suspended solids ( tss ) , turbidity ( optical density against distilled water , 660 nm ) , and chemical oxygen demand ( cod ) in supernatant .
the results obtained indicated that sludge containing wheat flour as a carbon source was a better co-substrate for microbial growth , with significant utilization for minimizing the dissolved and suspended materials in sludge .
effective results for optimum values were recoded at 4 d of microbial treatment .
we assessed the colonization risk of invertebrate nonindigenous species ( nis ) in ballast water being brought into canada &apos;s pacific coast by indirect and direct methods .
initially we mapped the locations in the northern pacific ocean where ships coming into vancouver harbour had performed mid-ocean exchange ( moe ) .
exchange transects ( the distance between the start and end positions for the onset and end of moe ) were on average about 400 km long .
samples were also taken from ballast tanks after filling at a northwestern pacific port and then again after moe in the mid-pacific .
invertebrate communities were different pre- and post-moe , but some coastal organisms were still present after flushing .
in addition , samples were obtained from ballast tanks aboard ships in vancouver harbour .
in &quot; low &quot; salinity samples ( &lt;25 ) , 13 different taxa were found , and 52 taxa were found in &quot; high &quot; salinity samples ( &gt;25 ) .
risks could be reduced if moe was performed in the southerly subtropical domain , south of the subarctic domain and transition zone in the mid-pacific , or well offshore for northsouth shipping routes .
for voyages on the west coast of north america , colonization risk of invertebrate nis is likely higher for ballast water from harbors already colonized by nis .
monoethanolamines ( mea ) are commonly used by the natural gas industry to remove acid gases from the natural gas stream .
a series of pan studies was conducted to examine the biodegradability of mea in soil recovered from a gas plant site under various environmental conditions .
experimental results indicate that mea was successfully biodegraded or transformed into other compounds under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions even at concentrations greater than 1500 mg/kg .
ammonium , acetate , and nitrogen gas were the dominant by-products in these experiments .
the generation of nitrogen gas suggests that simultaneous nitrification and denitrification occurred because of the existence of anoxic zones resulting from diffusion limited oxygen transport into the soils .
cold temperatures ( 5 °c ) reduced the biodegradation rates significantly compared to rates at room temperature .
the radiation properties of n axially slotted antenna on a lossy dielectric-coated elliptic cylinder are investigated .
the analysis is carried out by expressing the fields inside and outside the antenna structure in terms of elliptic waves using complex mathieu functions .
the boundary conditions at various surfaces are employed to obtain the unknown field expansion coefficients .
numerical results are presented graphically for the radiation pattern , aperture conductance , and antenna gain for the transverse magnetic field case .
postischemic temperature , which modulates brain injury , is commonly determined via a rectal temperature ( trec ) probe .
this procedure causes a stress-induced fever ( sif ) in rodents that may aggravate injury or diminish the efficacy of a neuroprotectant .
accordingly , postischemic trec measurements should be replaced with telemetry probes .
however , the frequency of multiple mating was relatively low .
reproductive success of males was highly skewed , as a few males monopolized most of the copulations recorded .
mortality of subadult spiders was independent of their sex , and the operational sex ratio was 1:1 .
a growing number of construction projects are performed in congested urban areas .
often , the surrounding community finds these projects annoying because of noise , vibration , dust , light , and greenhouse gas emissions .
this paper focuses on one type of irritant , noise .
common noise generators on construction sites are identified , and the elements of a generic program for mitigating construction-related noise are outlined .
mitigation strategies including source control , path control , and receiver control are discussed .
a deterministic model based on the monte carlo simulation technique is used .
it is capable of predicting the magnitude and frequency of noise levels generated by construction equipment at receptor locations around a construction site during each construction stage .
the utilization of the model as a planning tool for optimizing the composition , geometry , and location of noise barriers around a construction site is demonstrated via a case history , namely the construction of an eight-story parking garage in london , ont .
the model is validated by comparing its predictions to field measurements undertaken during various construction stages .
predictions agree favorably with field measurements .
recent studies indicate that most nuclear proteins , including histone h1 and hmg are highly mobile and their interaction with chromatin is transient .
while roaming the nucleus , the hmgn proteins encounter binding partners and form metastable multiprotein complexes , which modulate their chromatin interactions .
studies with hmgn proteins underscore the important role of protein dynamics in chromatin function .
the rnase was adsorbed on deae-cellulose , cm-sepharose , and q-sepharose .
it demonstrated a ph optimum of 4â4.5 and a temperature optimum of 60 °c .
there was a loss of rnase activity at temperatures above 60 °c .
dans ce présent article , nous discutons l&apos;interaction de la particule de spin 0 avec un potentiel d&apos;aharonovbohm à deux et trois dimensions par l&apos;application de l&apos;équation de duffinkemmerpetiau .
le specter d&apos;énergie et sa dépendance avec l&apos;intensité du potentiel d&apos;aharonovbohm sont analysés .
we examined the effects of adult common carp ( cyprinus carpio ) on shallow aquatic ecosystems and compared the effects with those of a native benthic fish , channel catfish ( ictalurus punctatus ) .
experimental ponds contained enclosures ( 0.06 ha ) with a low carp biomass ( 174 kg·ha1 ) , high carp biomass ( 476 kg·ha1 ) , high catfish biomass ( 416 kg·ha1 ) , and no fish .
we measured abiotic factors ( turbidity , suspended solids , total phosphorus ) , as well as effects on adjacent trophic levels ( aquatic macrophytes , zooplankton , and aquatic macroinvertebrates ) from july to september .
common carp was positively related to total phosphorus , turbidity , suspended solids , and zooplankton biomass , and negatively related to macrophyte and macroinvertebrate abundance .
suspended solids in the carp treatments consisted primarily of inorganic particles .
carp were either positively or negatively related to phytoplankton , depending on zooplankton abundance .
a high biomass of carp had greater effect on nutrients , turbidity , and suspended solids than a low biomass .
channel catfish was positively related to total phosphorus concentrations and altered zooplankton composition , but did not affect turbidity , suspended solids , macroinvertebrates , and macrophytes .
these results suggest that common carp have a stronger influence on water quality and aquatic community structure than benthic fish native to north america .
hemodynamic alterations during balloon carotid angioplasty ( bca ) and stenting have been ascribed to the consequences of direct carotid baroreceptor stimulation during balloon inflation .
bca with stenting in patients with carotid atheromatous stenoses offers a unique opportunity for elucidating the cardiovascular autonomic response to direct transient intravascular stimulation of the baroreceptors .
we analyzed the consequences of bca on the autonomic control of heart rate and on breathing components in nine patients with atheromatous stenoses involving the bifurcation and the internal carotid .
a timefrequency domain method , the smoothed pseudo-wignerville transform ( spwvt ) , was used to evaluate the spectral parameters ( i.e. , the instantaneous amplitude and center frequency ( icf ) of the cardiovascular and respiratory oscillations ) .
those parameters and their dynamics ( 8 and 24 h later ) were evaluated during and after the procedure .
bca stimulates baroreceptors in all patients , which markedly reduces heart rate and blood pressure .
vagal baroreflex activation altered the respiratory sinus arrhythmia in terms of amplitude and frequency ( icf hf rr shifted from 0.27 ± 0.03 to 0.23 ± 0.04 hz pre-bca vs. bca , respectively ; p &lt; 0.01 ) .
both the high- and low-frequency amplitudes of heart rate oscillations were altered during carotid baroreceptor stimulation , strongly supporting a contribution of the baroreflex to the generation of both oscillations of heart rate .
carotid baroreceptors stimulation increased the inspiratory time ( ti ) ( 1.5 ± 0.5 to 2.3 ± 0.6 s pre-bca vs. bca , respectively ; p &lt; 0.01 ) .
in awake patients , bca with stenting of atheromatous stenosis involving the bifurcation and internal carotid causes marked changes in the cardiac autonomic and respiratory control systems .
the soybean cyst nematode ( scn ) heterodera glycines is the most devastating pest of soybean in the u.s.a. the resistance response elicited by scn in soybean is complex , and genes involved in the response to a large extent are unknown and not well characterized .
we constructed cdna libraries made from mrna extracted from roots of the resistant soybean glycine max l. merr . &apos;
peking &apos; at 12 h , 2 to 4 days , and 6 to 8 days post inoculation with the soybean cyst nematode , population nl1-rhp , similar to race 3 .
a total of 3454 cdna clones were examined from the three libraries , of which 25 cdnas were derived from nematode rna .
these ests and associated information will be useful to scientists examining gene and protein interactions between nematodes and plants .
there is currently a great deal of interest in using stable-isotope methods to investigate diet and migratory connections in wild passerines .
to apply these methods successfully , it is important to understand how stable isotopes discriminate or change between diet and the tissue of interest and what the element-turnover rates are in metabolically active tissues .
of particular use are studies that sample birds non-destructively through the use of blood and feathers .
we established that the discrimination factors between diet and blood appropriate for stable carbon ( &amp;#948;13c ) and nitrogen ( &amp;#948;15n ) isotopes are +1.7 and +2.4 , respectively .
for feathers , these values were +2.7 and +4 , respectively .
turnover of elemental nitrogen in whole blood was best approximated by an exponential-decay model with a half-life of 11.0 ± 0.8 days ( mean ± sd ) .
corresponding turnover of carbon was estimated to range from 5.0 ± 0.7 to 5.7 ± 0.8 days .
we conclude that this decoupling of nitrogen- and carbon-turnover rates can be explained by differences in metabolic routing of dietary macromolecules .
our results suggest that tracking frugivory in migratory passerines that switch diets between insects and fruits may be complicated if only a trophic-level estimate is made using &amp;#948;15n measurements .
the question of what composed the earth &apos;s oldest fossils is the subject of current debate .
at present , taphonomical determination of archean silicified microfossils is largely based on morphological comparisons with extant microorganisms .
this method has significant shortcomings because little is known about which types of bacteria silicify , what physical changes are induced on those species during mineralization , and , most importantly , what their preservation potential is .
terrestrial hot springs may help resolve these uncertainties because the silica-supersaturated geothermal fluids mineralize a wide variety of natural microbial communities and thus lead to the formation of numerous distinct biofacies .
some of these biofacies are reminiscent of archean siliceous stromatolites from which the oldest microfossils were recovered .
we suggest that by integrating molecular techniques that characterize the indigenous microbial populations growing in different biofacies with electron microscopy , we may be able to assess better what types of ancient microbes could have become fossilized .
recent studies have provided new insight into the mechanism through which this factor acts at various levels of gene regulation .
a new growth model is fitted on data from reared sea urchins , paracentrotus lividus .
quantile regressions are used instead of least-square regressions , because they are insensitive to the dimension of the measurement and accommodate more than just symmetrical distributions .
quantile regressions allow comparison of fittings on various parts of the size distributions , including large competitors versus small , inhibited animals , in the presence of a size-based intraspecific competition .
the model has functionally interpretable parameters and allows quantifying of the intensity of growth inhibition .
an extension of this model , called &quot; envelope model &quot; , fits the whole data set at once , including size distributions .
its parameters are constrained using information about underlying biological processes involved , namely asymptotic growth with inhibition in early ages as the result of intraspecific competition , the intensity of which depends on the relative size of the individual in the cohort .
the new model appears most adequate to describe growth of p. lividus and probably many other sea urchins species as well as other animals or plants .
two dna markers , sequence-characterized amplified region ( scar ) ae08780 and scar 354520 , known to be linked to and flanking a putative sex determination locus in salix viminalis l. , were tested in another shrubform willow , salix eriocephala michx .
marker analysis of seven female and eight male s. eriocephala clones used to produce 34 fullsib families reveals that five pairs of parents are alternatively polymorphic relative to reciprocal male and female combinations for the two marker loci .
a goodness-of-fit test of marker presence or absence and relationship to gender suggests that the occurrence of scar 354520 is not significantly different ( c2 = 3.18 , df = 1 , p &gt; 0.05 ) from the expected ratio of marker presence:absence in the male and female progenies across all five families , indicating no relationship to gender .
however , the occurrence of scar ae08780 differs significantly from expected ( c2 = 21.05 , df = 1 , p &lt; 0.001 ) in the five families and seems to be linked to femaleness in s. eriocephala .
within a single family , 984 ( n = 54 ) , both markers show a significant deviation from expected at p &lt; 0.01 ( scar ae08780 : c2 = 11.37 , df = 1 ; scar 354520 : c2 = 9.49 , df = 1) .
these data support the hypothesis that there is an association between the markers and a locus associated with gender in two divergent species and that there may be a common sex determination mechanism in willow .
we assessed the tolerance to ultraviolet b ( uvb ; 290-320 nm ) radiation and uvb-induced mutability in 28 pseudomonas spp. and four burkholderia cepacia strains .
the uvb survival of 23 ( 72 % ) of the strains was elevated ( &gt;46 % survival following irradiation with a 2250 j m-2 dose ) , and 17 ( 53 % ) strains were defined as mutable by uvb .
a mutagenic dna repair determinant was cloned and characterized from the highly mutable strain p. cichorii 302959 and shown by sequence analysis to be an allele of rulab , a mutagenic dna repair determinant previously characterized from pseudomonas syringae .
phylogenetic analyses of rula- and rulb-related sequences indicated that the sequences identified in environmental bacteria shared a common ancestor with umudc-like sequences from enteric bacteria but were considerably diverged .
the dynamics of uvb-induced mutability to nalidixic acid resistance ( nalr ) and rifampicin resistance ( rifr ) were studied in replicate populations of p. cichorii 302959 subjected to a daily uvb dose of 2250 j m-2 for 14 consecutive days .
while there was an initial spike in the frequency of nalr and rifr mutants recovered on days 1 and 2 of two separate experiments , the frequencies were sharply reduced and then fluctuated throughout the duration of both experiments .
these experimental results are intriguing because they point to the possibility that p. cichorii possesses additional mechanisms to curtail the induction of spontaneous mutants following repeated episodes of uvb irradiation .
we use two rate-process models to describe cell mortality at elevated temperatures as a means of understanding vascular cambium cell death during surface fires .
in the models , cell death is caused by irreversible damage to cellular molecules that occurs at rates that increase exponentially with temperature .
the models differ in whether cells show cumulative effects of heating .
the temperature dependencies of the models &apos; rate parameters were estimated from cell-count data after exposing live-bark tissues from four canadian rocky mountain tree species to a range of fixed temperatures in a water bath .
franco ) .
growing and dormant season differences were marginal .
with reservations for lodgepole pine , both models predicted cell survival after exposures to rising and falling temperatures such as would be experienced by live tissues during fires .
a simulation involving conduction heat transfer from flames and vascular cambium cell mortality suggests that differences among species in thermal tolerance are small compared with the effects of bark thickness .
although stem vascular cambium cell mortality was complete when tissues reached 60 °c during simulated surface fires , it may not be warranted to apply the 60 °c threshold to other tissues exposed to contrasting temperature regimes during fires .
flood risk management for residences requires an economical analysis involving the mean annual damage by floods , taking into account the whole range of probability of floods and the cost of projected fluvial enhancements and measures , taking also into account the residual level of risk .
efficient methods are therefore necessary to estimate these risk values .
the proposed approach is of a &quot; distributed &quot; type ; it involves numerical modeling for estimating &quot; residential submersion depth &quot; , a variable , which explains most of the direct damages to residences .
the method relies on an individualized georeferenced definition of each residence .
for distinct relationships were established : residences with or without a basement and valued below or above $ 50,000 each were assigned a specific relationship .
although active targeting of abalone aggregations is documented for various species , its impact on large aggregations is poorly understood .
as large aggregations make the greatest contribution to reproductive success , yet are vulnerable to exploitation , it is important to understand how targeted fishing impacts aggregation structure .
the effect of targeted fishing on greenlip abalone ( haliotis laevigata ) aggregations was verified by simulating three different levels of &quot; random &quot; fishing behavior to generate postfishing aggregation frequency distributions .
comparison of the output with postfishing survey distributions suggested that observed aggregation patterns could not have resulted from random search behavior .
the aggregation survey data can therefore be used as a valid basis on which to quantify both fishing behavior in terms of aggregation-specific catch patterns and the response of aggregations to fishing .
in part i , a benchmark model without any liquefaction remediation countermeasure was considered and numerical results were compared with centrifuge experiment results .
in part ii , three additional models with remediation are analyzed and compared with centrifuge experiments conducted on identical models .
the countermeasures considered are densification of the sand layer by compaction , gravel berm surcharge , and sheet pile enclosure .
in addition to comparing numerical results with experimental data for each model , the effect of each countermeasure relative to the benchmark model is also discussed .
insights into the dynamic behavior of the employed embankmentfoundation and liquefaction countermeasure systems are provided .
the results of this study show that computer simulation of earthquake effects on embankments with liquefiable foundations with and without several different retrofit measures is possible using data from conventional laboratory tests and a verified numerical procedure .
retroelements have proved useful for molecular marker studies and play an important role in genome evolution .
ty1-copia retrotransposons are ubiquitous and heterogeneous in plant genomes , and although many elements have been isolated and characterized , almost no information about them is available in the literature for phaseolus vulgaris l. we report here the isolation and characterization of new rnase long terminal repeat ( ltr ) sections of the ty1-copia group for this crop plant .
rnase sections showed conserved amino acids with the downstream sections corresponding to the polypurine-tract and 5 &apos; sections of 3 &apos; ltrs .
the rnase sections were aligned using clustalx to find potential relationships between sequences .
a comparison with this analysis was made using the partition analysis of quasispecies package ( paq ) , which is specific for quasispecies-like populations .
the analysis revealed eight distinct groups .
to uncover ltr variability and potential conserved promoter motifs , we also designed new primers from the presumed polypurine-tract regions .
a similarity search found short stretches similar to upstream and downstream regions of some genes .
conserved motifs , corresponding to transcription factor binding sites , were discovered through matinspector software and two sequences characterized .
from a putative ltr fragment , we then designed a new primer , which , through sequence-specific amplification polymorphism ( ssap ) , showed numerous polymorphic bands between two distinct p. vulgaris accessions .
this work studied the effects of ethanol in the absence and presence of haloperidol under two experimental conditions .
in protocol 1 , rats were treated daily with ethanol ( 4 g/kg , p.o. ) for 7 days , and received only haloperidol ( 1 mg/kg , i.p. ) from the 8th day to the 14th day .
in protocol 2 , animals received ethanol , and the treatment continued with ethanol and haloperidol from the 8th day to the 14th day .
results show increases in alanine transaminase ( alt ; 48 % and 55 % ) and aspartate transaminase ( ast ; 32 % and 22 % ) levels after ethanol or haloperidol ( 14 days ) treatments , as compared with controls .
apolipoprotein a-1 ( apo a1 ) levels were increased by haloperidol , after 7- ( 148 % ) but not after 14-day treatments , as compared with controls .
levels of lipoprotein ( high-density lipoprotein ( hdl-c ) ) tended to be increased only by ethanol treatment for 14 days .
alt ( 80 % ) and ast ( 43 % ) levels were increased in the haloperidol plus ethanol group ( protocol 2) , as compared with controls .
however , an increase in apo a1 levels was observed in the haloperidol group pretreated with ethanol ( protocol 1) , as compared with controls and ethanol 7-day treatments .
triglyceride ( tg ) levels were increased in the combination of ethanol and haloperidol in protocol 1 ( 234 % ) and 2 ( 106 % ) , as compared with controls .
except for a small decrease in haloperidol groups , with or without ethanol , as related to ethanol alone , no other effect was observed in hdl-c levels .
in conclusion , we showed that haloperidol might be effective in moderating lipid alterations caused by chronic alcohol intake .
in the presence of the two bacterial species , adsorption coefficients of the two soil horizons rises .
because chaoborus larvae take up most of their cadmium ( cd ) from food , we tested the hypothesis that cd concentrations in this insect are directly related to those in their planktonic prey .
we measured cd in chaoborus and in zooplankton collected from 24 eastern canadian lakes varying widely in their cd concentrations .
cd concentrations in the predator were not correlated with those in bulk zooplankton , whether separated into size fractions liable to be eaten by chaoborus or not .
in highly acidic lakes , cd concentrations in chaoborus did not respond to increases in zooplankton cd because of either competition between h and cd ions at cd absorption sites in the predator &apos;s gut or differences in prey community composition between highly acidic and circumneutral lakes .
relationships between cd in chaoborus and in its potential prey were stronger when we used cd concentrations for specific crustacean taxa in a mechanistic model .
we conclude that predictive relationships between metal concentrations in predators and their prey are likely to be strongest if the subset of prey consumed by the predator has been characterized and if this information is used in a bioaccumulation model .
this paper presents a study of ocher formation on geotextile filters .
ochre is a substance found sticking to solid surfaces of drainage systems and may cause clogging .
ochre formation is discussed based on the new concepts of biofilm development .
ochre formation is the result of microbial colonization and its affinity to iron compounds naturally found in seepage water .
the aerobicnonaerobic interface in drainage systems is a very favorable locale for optimum development of iron bacteria .
laboratory studies were done to verify the influence of intrinsic characteristics of the geotextiles and environment on ocher formation .
because flow condition was not considered in the tests , however , these results may not represent real field performance of geotextile filters .
tests of biofilm formation were conducted in erlenmeyer flasks containing culture mediums for iron bacteria and geotextile samples .
nonwoven polyester , nonwoven polypropylene , and woven polypropylene geotextiles were used in the tests .
the study was performed considering different levels of iron concentration , available dissolved oxygen , and ph. laboratory tests have shown the fundamental importance of iron bacteria activity , type of geotextile , and environmental conditions on ocher formation .
experimental exclosures showed that predators reduced recruitment rates , on average , by 46 % for seeds exposed to predation for 6 weeks in the summer and by 79 % for seeds exposed to predation between autumn ( seed dispersal ) and the following summer ( germination ) .
we were unable to detect an influence of initial seed density on recruitment rates .
the nature of meiotic genetic recombination was resolved at the dna level by the 1953 watson and crick model .
what remains to be determined are the roles of the various recombination proteins and the distribution and localization of recombination events in the meiotic prophase nucleus .
aspen ( populus tremuloides michx. ) is a clonal tree species that commonly regenerates via root suckering after disturbance .
this paper reviews the literature and identifies critical gaps in our understanding of the dynamics of aspen root suckering .
the paper presents a series of conceptual figures summarizing our knowledge of the factors controlling suckering dynamics and identifies areas of future research .
strategies for the construction of cyclic molecules containing variably substituted bicyclo&#91;5.3.1&#93;undecenones ( ab taxane ring systems ) are described .
these routes employ a multi-component coupling protocol that utilizes sequential magnesium-mediated carbometallation of propargyl alcohols and intramolecular dielsalder reactions ( imda ) .
the cycloaddition generates the key eight-membered taxane ring as a single diastereomer , induced by preferential lewis acid ( diethylaluminum chloride or boron trifluoride etherate ) complexation with the cross-ring oxygens .
both the electronic nature of the dienophile and the neighboring group non-bonded interactions contribute to the success of these cycloadditions .
in animal species without parental care , the fitness of males should increase with the number of females encountered , court , and fertilise , and the fitness of females depends strongly on the quantity and quality of resources acquired .
this should translate into a marked sex differences in the patterns of space utilisation .
we analyzed the sex divergences in home range and movements pattern in the steppe tortoise ( testudo horsfieldi ) in uzbekistan .
the females movements were more unidirectional , resulting in large loops over a very extended home range .
we proposed several nonexclusive hypothesis for such a pattern .
this note seeks to extend the utility of size-biased distribution theory as applied to forestry through two relationships regarding the quadratic mean stand diameter .
second , a new result , which may prove most valuable in viewing the graphical representation of assumed distributions , is also derived .
the results are also shown to apply to the basal area  size distribution , providing a unique duality between the two means .
an anaerobic microbial consortium able to biodegrade saturation levels of perchlorethylene ( pce ) in a column containing a source zone of pce was examined phylogenetically to determine microbial community structure and spatial variation in relation to the pce source .
the consortium was comprised of at least 34 members with 7 organisms sharing affiliations with known respiratory or cometabolic dechlorinators .
seven other organisms had their closest phylogenetic relative detected in other environments containing chlorinated compounds .
based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis , significant bacteria were dehalococcoides ethenogenes , shewanella putrefaciens , and an acetobacterium species .
spatial variations in community structure of the consortium relative to the pce source zone were observed .
a pseudomonas species was predominant in a zone 30 cm from the pce source .
a methanothrix species was predominant at points over 85 cm from the source zone .
a trichlorobacter species was detected where pce concentrations were highest , up to 85 cm from the pce source , whereas d. ethenogenes was ubiquitous to over 128 cm from the pce source .
we previously reported a dual kinetics of ca2+ transport by the distal tubule luminal membrane of the kidney , suggesting the presence of several types of channels .
to better characterize these channels , we examined the effects of specific inhibitors ( i.e. , diltiazem , an l-type channel ; ï-conotoxin mviic , a p/q-type channel ; and mibefradil , a t-type channel antagonist ) on 0.1 and 0.5 mm ca2+ uptake by rabbit nephron luminal membranes .
none of these inhibitors influenced ca2+ uptake by the proximal tubule membranes .
these results not only confirm that the distal luminal membrane is the site of ca2+ channels , but they suggest that these channels belong to the l , p/q , and t types .
fisheries scientists and managers are concerned about potential long-term , persistent changes in productivity of fish stocks that might result from future climatic changes or other alterations in aquatic systems .
however , because of large natural variability and measurement error in fisheries data , such changes are usually difficult to detect until long after they occur .
previous research using numerous monte carlo simulation trials showed that a kalman filter performed better than standard estimation techniques in detecting such trends in a timely manner .
therefore , we used historical data along with a kalman filter that included a time-varying ricker a parameter to reconstruct changes in productivity ( recruits per spawner at a given spawner abundance ) of eight bristol bay , alaska , sockeye salmon ( oncorhynchus nerka ) stocks over the past 40 years .
productivity generally increased for most stocks but varied widely for others and dramatically decreased in another .
such large changes in productivity are important for management .
they greatly affected optimal spawner abundances and optimal exploitation rates , suggesting that in the future , scientists should consider using models with time-varying productivity parameters .
the application of back-propagation neural networks ( bpnns ) was assessed for modeling residual chlorine decay , total thm concentrations ( tthms ) , and three individual thm species ( chcl3 , chbrcl2 , and chbr2cl ) in water that was chlorinated under laboratory-scale conditions .
data for modeling chlorine decay and tthm were generated in chlorination experiments carried out with water collected in water utilities of the quebec city region , whereas data for thm species were provided by the us geological survey for the mississippi river and its tributaries .
the bpnn models were compared with conventional models developed with exactly the same data .
results showed that the ability of bpnn to model residual chlorine decay is , in general terms , comparable to the ability of kinetic first- and second-order models .
for tthms and thm speciation , however , the ability of bpnn was clearly higher in comparison with multivariate regression models , in particular when brominated disinfection by-products ( dbps ) ( chbrcl2 and chbr2cl ) were modeled .
the successful application of bpnn presented in this study opens the door to other potential applications of bpnn for field-scale data concerning thms as well as for other relevant disinfection by-products .
in both species , most natural regeneration was clumped and located at the margin of the gaps ; however , fir saplings were more represented in understorey environments and less represented in gaps as compared with spruce .
age structure of natural regeneration in the selected gap revealed that the majority ( 75 % ) of saplings appeared after the formation of the gap ; however , for regeneration taller than 2 m ( which has a better chance of reaching the uppermost canopy layer ) , saplings already present at gap formation predominated .
we conclude that (i) gap edges represent a preferential regeneration niche in this forest and ( ii ) saplings established before gap formation can play an important role in gap refilling .
these results provide useful information to ensure , through silvicultural practices , favorable conditions for the temporal and spatial continuity of the regeneration process .
we studied predatorprey interactions between juvenile atlantic salmon ( salmo salar ) and trout in three massachusetts , u.s.a. , streams and in artificial streams .
we sampled stomach contents of age-1+ and older salmon and trout ( salvelinus fontinalis , salmo trutta ) following salmon fry stocking in the spring of 1997 and 1998 .
between 4.3 and 48.6 % of the stocked fry were consumed within the first 2 days after stocking , and total fry mortality from predation varied from 4.3 to 60.7 % .
no significant differences were found between stomach weights of predators ( without fry weight ) that consumed fry and those that did not .
artificial stream experiments testing effects of habitat complexity and predator species on predator consumption rates revealed that consumption rates were not different between brook ( s. fontinalis ) and brown ( s. trutta ) trout ( p = 0.59 ) .
predation rate tended to decrease as the percentage of riffle habitat increased but the decrease was not significant ( p = 0.22 ) .
our results indicate that predation on stocked atlantic salmon fry can be substantial ( up to 60 % ) , appears to be short lived ( 2 days ) , and is not related in a simple way to abiotic and biotic factors .
protocols were developed for both chromosome counts and flow cytometry to assess ploidy level and dna content for populations of arabidopsis lyrata l. sampled from europe ( arabidopsis lyrata subsp. petraea ) , north america ( arabidopsis lyrata subsp. lyrata ) , and japan ( arabidopsis lyrata subsp. kawasakiana ) .
ploidy variation within this species is not clear , with previous studies having documented both diploid and tetraploid populations .
chromosome counts in this study confirmed ploidy expectations for all populations examined .
individuals from iceland and north america were diploid ( 2n = 2x = 16 ) , whereas those from japanese and austrian populations were tetraploid ( 2n = 4x = 32 ) .
flow cytometry was also used successfully to distinguish between ploidy levels , but the need to calibrate dna content measures with chromosome counts was demonstrated by a deviation from the expected 2:1 ratio between tetraploid and diploid values among european populations ( a. lyrata subsp. petraea ) .
this deviation might be explained by a hybrid ( allopolyploid ) origin or by genomic changes following polyploidization , emphasizing the dynamic nature of polyploid genomes .
variation in dna content among families was found only for north american populations , but these individuals were sampled from a broader geographic range than those from other regions .
upb dates on baddeleyite yield ages of 2167.8 ± 2.2 and 2171.6 ± 1.2 ma on two northeast-trending dykes west of the kapuskasing zone in ontario , canada .
these ages identify the dykes as belonging to the biscotasing dyke swarm east of the kapuskasing zone , which was previously dated at 2166.7 ± 1.4 ma by upb on baddeleyite and zircon .
this movement may have been accompanied by rifting farther north which ultimately led to the paleoproterozoic embayment , underlying hudson bay , that gives the superior province its characteristic butterfly-shaped outline .
a study was established in coastal british columbia to determine if repeated nitrogen (n) and phosphorus (p) fertilization negatively influences the reestablishment of salal ( gaultheria shallon pursh ) on cleared and burned cedarhemlock ( thuja plicata donn ex d. don  tsuga heterophylla ( raf . )
sarg. ) forests .
fertilizers were applied for 3 years , and the biomass of ground vegetation and conifer seedling survival and growth were measured .
salal biomass decreased with high levels of n application ( 1000 kg n/ha ) , but not when 400 kg p/ha was added with 1000 kg n/ha .
the addition of 500 kg n/ha , with or without p , stimulated salal growth .
the biomass of fireweed ( epilobium angusti folium l. ) increased with the addition of n + p but not with n alone .
in the high n and n + p treatments , conifer seedling survival and heights were reduced .
these results confirm earlier reports that salal responds negatively to high n applications and that this negative response can be alleviated with simultaneous additions of p. the response of fireweed to n + p , but not to n alone , suggests that the abundance of this species is more indicative of p than n availability .
the sensitivity of dred-gamdren mutants of bacteriophage l to rex exclusion by lrexa+rexb+ lysogens is modulated by the prophage ci repressor allele .
a series of monolayer-protected clusters ( mpcs ) modified with a photoreactive &#91;4-(11-mercaptoundecyl)-phenyl&#93;(2-methylphenyl)methanone (1) moiety have been prepared where 1 is co-absorbed to the mpc surface with dodecanethiol , octadecanethiol , or 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid methyl ester .
upon irradiation the mpc-anchored 1 reacts efficiently through its triplet excited states , yielding 1,4-biradicals that collapse to synthetically useful , long-lived photodienol intermediates , which can be efficiently trapped in dielsalder type chemistry by dienophiles  namely , dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate ( dmad ) .
in all cases the dielsalder trapping of the dienol occurred efficiently resulting in &gt;60 % conversion to the dielsalder adduct .
this indicates that the local environment surrounding 1 did not influence its ability to react via the dielsalder reaction ; however , the reaction could not be taken to completion .
the inability to react completely is attributed to 1 binding to distinct sites on the mpc core ; there are edge , vertice , and terrace sites .
selective population of these specific sites and the subsequent irradiations show that mpcs with 1 anchored predominantly at edge and vertice sites results in an extent of reaction of 85 ± 3 % , whereas selectively populating the terrace sites results in an extent of reaction of 36 ± 2 % .
these results suggest that 1 anchored to edge and vertice sites is more reactive to the dielsalder reaction than that involving terrace sites .
a fecundity study of the eastern scotian shelf haddock ( melanogrammus aeglefinus ) stock during the 19971999 spawning seasons is reported .
we developed a model that accounted for fecundity changes at the individual level and that could be used to estimate population egg production beyond the study period .
incorporating condition factors into the model ( relative condition factor ( kn ) and hepatosomatic index ) accounted for a significant proportion of the residual variation .
the model predicted that a change in kn from 0.8 to 1.0 resulted in a twofold increase in fecundity at length .
this variability was as great as that observed for fecunditylength relationships among stocks .
three time series ( 19792001 ) of total egg production ( tep ) were constructed using different fecundity relationships : one with a condition effect , one based on length only , and one based on weight only .
the magnitude of change in tep resulting from the condition effect ranged from +30 to 20 % .
condition effects during the first half of the time series resulted in an enhancement of tep , whereas in the latter half , condition effects depressed tep .
this evaluation of tep generated new insights into haddock stock dynamics but did not result in a dramatic improvement of the relationship between recruitment and stock reproductive potential .
possible mitigation of nitrate losses associated with clearcuts through harvesting smaller gaps was tested in a high-elevation forest of engelmann spruce ( picea engelmannii parry ex engelm. ) and subalpine fir ( abies lasiocarpa ( hook . )
nutt. ) .
we measured concentrations of ammonium and nitrate after 6-week buried bag incubations of forest floor and mineral soil samples in replicated plots of uncut forest and gaps of 10 , 1.0 , and 0.1 ha and single-tree removal for 7 years after harvest .
nitrate concentrations in forest floor and mineral soil were elevated 37 years after harvesting in gaps of 0.1 ha and larger .
removal of the same proportion of trees as single trees did not result in increased nitrate concentrations , suggesting that nitrate losses could be reduced by harvesting single trees rather than creating gaps .
greater n availability was not associated with faster rates of decomposition of litter and forest floor , which were similar in gaps of all sizes ( 010 ha ) .
reciprocal transplant of forest floor and soil from the 10-ha gaps and the uncut forests indicated that changes in the nature of the forest floor or soil following harvest had a greater influence on nitrate concentrations than the changes in environmental conditions in the gaps .
direct estimates of sequence diversity provides an abundant source of dna polymorphisms based on single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) .
the frequency and distribution of nucleotide diversity within 23 genes associated with grain germination in barley were determined in a sample of accessions representing european cultivars , landraces , and wild barley accessions from throughout the fertile crescent .
during the pullout test , the pullout clamping system was modified and installed inside the pullout box with confinement from the fill material , hereinafter called the in-soil pullout test , which significantly reduced the necking phenomenon and the displacements mobilized during the pullout test .
subsequently , an analytical model was developed to predict the in-soil pullout resistance .
in addition , a numerical modeling analysis , under the three-dimensional stress field conditions using the flac3d ( fast lagrangian analysis continua ) program , was carried out to simulate the behavior of in-soil pullout tests .
the laboratory in-soil pullout test results were then compared with the corresponding data obtained from the analytical and numerical modeling methods .
the in-soil pullout resistance was greater than the corresponding result from previous pullout tests wherein the clamping system was conventionally installed outside the pullout box .
the predicted pullout resistance results from flac3d agreed reasonably with the results from laboratory tests and with the results from the analytical modeling .
the interaction coefficients , r , applied in the finite difference modeling of in-soil pullout tests were 0.90 and 0.65 for zinc-coated and polyvinyl chloride ( pvc ) coated hexagonal wire meshes , respectively .
the predicted and measured pullout resistance of zinc-coated hexagonal wire mesh is approximately 20 % greater than that of pvc-coated hexagonal wire mesh at the same applied normal pressure , because of the higher stiffness , ea , and higher shear stiffness , ks , of the zinc-coated mesh .
excitation functions of the reactions 185re&#91;(î±,n) ; ( î±,2n ) ; ( î±,3n ) &#93; and 187re&#91;(î±,n) ; ( î±,2n ) ; ( î±,3n ) ; ( î±,4n ) &#93; were investigated up to 50 mev using the stacked-foil activation technique and high-purity germanium î³-ray spectroscopy method .
since the natural rhenium used as a target has two odd-mass stable isotopes of abundance 37.4 % ( 185re ) and 62.6 % ( 187re ) , their activation in some cases gives the same residual nucleus through different reaction channels , but with very different q values .
in such cases , the individual reaction cross sections are separated with the help of the ratio of theoretical cross sections .
the experimental cross sections were compared with the theoretical predictions considering equilibrium as well as pre-equilibrium contributions using code alice/90 .
it was found that the initial exciton configuration n0 = 4 ( 4p0h ) appears to give a good fit to the experimental data .
relationships between energy density ( kj·100 g1 ) and body length ( mm ) , which varied between life-history stages of atlantic salmon ( salmo salar ) , were described by power functions .
the variation was chiefly caused by differences in lipid concentrations .
energy densities of maturing and rematuring parr were higher than those of similarly aged smolts .
monthly specific growth rate was higher in maturing parr than in salmon at sea .
more energy was used in reproduction in a long river than in a short one .
male allocation to gonads relative to soma was highest in the shorter river .
energy allocation pattern varied among developmental stages .
very energy-rich male parr rematured in subsequent years without going to sea ; less energy-rich ones smolted and migrated to sea .
body size influences most biological processes from metabolic rates to the outcome of interspecific interactions .
within a species , sexual size dimorphism ( ssd ) reflects either differential selection on body size of males and females or phylogenetic inertia .
among taxa , ssd should decrease as body size increases when females are the larger sex â a pattern known as rensch &apos;s rule .
we examined body size , ssd , and rensch &apos;s rule among 29 species of adult hydropsychid caddisflies ( trichoptera : hydropsychidae ) and 12 closely related caddisfly species .
females were almost always larger than males in all species examined .
body size variation among genera was greater than variance among species .
in contrast , the greatest variance in ssd was among species within a genus .
contrary to rensch &apos;s rule , the degree of ssd did not change as body size increased among genera .
observed body size patterns suggest that hydro psychid caddisfly species within a genus may be subjected to similar selective pressures during the larval stage , but this issue remains to be investigated .
in addition , our data suggest that hydropsychids may violate rensch &apos;s rule , a pattern not often reported .
our data provide a basis for proposing and testing hypotheses about the ecology and evolution of hydropsychid caddisflies .
the purpose of this study was to determine whether a relationship existed between the diel surfacing trends of the bimodally respiring freshwater turtle rheodytes leukops and daily fluctuations in specific biotic and abiotic factors .
the diel surfacing behavior of adult r. leukops was recorded over four consecutive seasons ( austral autumn 2000  summer 2001 ) within marlborough creek , central queensland , australia , using pressure-sensitive time-depth recorders .
additionally , diurnal variations in water temperature and aquatic po2 level , as well as the turtle &apos;s behavioral state ( i.e. , active versus resting ) , were monitored .
in autumn and summer , surfacing frequency increased significantly during the daylight hours , with peak levels normally occurring around dawn ( 05000700 ) and dusk ( 17001900 ) .
however , no consistent diel surfacing trend was recorded for the turtles in winter or spring , owing to considerable variation among individual r. leukops .
diurnal surfacing trends recorded for r. leukops in autumn and summer are attributed to periods of increased activity ( possibly associated with foraging ) during the daylight hours and not to daily variations in water temperature or aquatic po2 level .
turtles generally remained at a depth greater than 1 m throughout the day , where the effect of diel fluctuations in water temperature ( &lt;0.5 °c ) and aquatic po2 level ( &lt;15 mm hg ( 1 mm hg = 133.322 pa ) ) was considered to be negligible .
the multiplicity and pseudorapidity distributions of shower particles produced in interactions of the 24mg at 4.5a gev/c was studied in nuclear emulsion .
the results indicated that the multiplicity distributions of shower particles produced in the collisions depend on the projectile mass .
the pseudorapidity distributions are approximately gaussian in shape .
to present quantitative knowledge of photoperiod and temperature on frost hardiness for mathematical modeling , we carried out a growth chamber experiment for second-year scots pine ( pinus sylvestris l. ) seedlings .
there was a clear difference in hardiness among the organs by the end of the experiment .
a stationary level of frost hardiness was reached or asymptotically approached in all organs and treatments except in the sdht treatment of buds .
the results show that the additive model needs revision , since the hardening response is dependent on organ , and there is an interaction in the responses to photoperiod and temperature .
new reos molybdenite and upb zircon dates from deposits of the tombstone gold belt provide direct timing constraints for sulfide mineralization and crystallization of spatially associated plutons .
at clear creek reos molybdenite dates ( 93.6 ± 0.3 to 92.4 ± 0.4 ma ) are in excellent agreement with the host intrusion upb zircon age ( 92.3 ± 0.3 ma ) .
consequently we propose the nominally younger existing 40ar/39ar hydrothermal mica ages ( 91.7 ± 0.4 and 90.0 ± 0.3 ma ) for clear creek are a result of slow cooling .
at dublin gulch , the reos molybdenite date ( 93.2 ± 0.3 ma ) for a late stage vein is nominally younger than the host intrusion upb zircon age ( 94.0 ± 0.3 ma ) , in agreement with the deposits paragenesis .
the upb zircon date ( 92.1 ± 0.2 ma ) for the mactung pluton , which lies adjacent to the w-skarn , has a younger age than the reos molybdenite dates ( 97.5 ± 0.5 ma ) .
fluid inclusion geochemical data for ore-fluid indicate a magmatic origin for the w-skarn .
however , the upb and reos age data suggest that the exposed mactung stock is not the source of ore-fluid for the w-skarn and that the progenitor pluton for ore-fluid is unknown .
the robust age constraints obtained for mineralization and magmatism in this study are in accord with the hypothesis that these deposits are intrusion-related ore systems .
the results are also in agreement with previous studies demonstrating that the reos molybdenite chronometer can provide accurate and precise dates for the timing of metallic mineralization with rigorous sampling protocol .
a total of 34 fecal samples , collected from 14 species of wild mammals in korea , were examined for the occurrence of bacillus thuringiensis .
the organism was detected in 18 ( 53 % ) samples .
among the three food-habit groups , herbivorous animals yielded the highest frequency ( 69 % ) of samples positive for b. thuringiensis , followed by omnivorous animals ( 50 % ) .
of the six fecal samples from carnivorous animals , only one sample contained b. thurin giensis .
among 527 isolates belonging to the bacillus cereus  b. thuringiensis group , 43 ( 8 % ) were assigned to b. thurin giensis on the basis of the formation of parasporal inclusions .
of the 43 isolates , 13 were serologically allocated to the nine h-antigenic serotypes : h3ad ( serovar sumiyoshiensis ) , h15 ( dakota ) , h17/27 ( tohokuensis/ mexicanensis ) , h19 ( tochigiensis ) , h21 ( colmeri ) , h29 ( amagiensis ) , h31/49 ( toguchini/muju ) , h42 ( jinghongiensis ) , and h44 ( higo ) .
other isolates were untestable or untypable by the 55 reference h antisera available .
insecticidal activity was associated with 23 % of the fecal populations : three isolates killed larvae of the silkworm , bombyx mori ( lepidoptera ) , and seven exhibited larvicidal activity against the mosquito , aedes aegypti ( diptera ) .
there was no larvicidal activity against the three lepidopterous insects : plutella xylostella , spodoptera exigua , and spodoptera litura .
the overall results suggest that wild animals in korea are in contact with naturally occurring b. thuringiensis at high frequencies through the daily food intake of plants .
morphological and structural changes among and within leaves of aphananthe monoica ( hemsley ) leroy , pleuranthodendron lindenii ( turczaninov ) sleumer , and psychotria costivenia grisebach were documented through canopy strata ( &lt;10 , 1020 , and &gt;20 m high ) and related to some environmental variables in a semi-evergreen neotropical forest .
the principal components analysis revealed that two components explained 93 % of total variation .
the first component ( 76.4 % ) denoted leaf structure , whereas the second ( 16.6 % ) denoted leaf shape .
anatomical differences in transverse leaf sections among different canopy strata were observed in aphananthe monoica and pleuranthodendron lindenii .
variance analyses showed significant differences among strata for leaf characters and light , relative humidity , vapor pressure deficit , and temperature .
canonical correlation analysis revealed that the first pair of canonical variates of leaf characters and environmental variables were closely related .
the first environmental variate represented the changes in microclimate along forest canopy strata .
leaf structure observed in aphananthe monoica and pleuranthodendron lindenii suggested that they are intermediate shade-tolerant species , and psychotria costivenia is a shade-tolerant understorey species .
aphananthe monoica and pleuranthodendron lindenii , which during their life span occupy different positions in the vertical strata , showed the highest leaf variation .
the utility of single taxonomic groups as indicators of biodiversity variation in other taxa has recently gained increasing attention , but such studies on stream organisms are lacking .
we studied the diversity patterns of mayflies , stoneflies , caddisflies , and chironomid midges across 110 headwater streams in finland .
specifically , we examined if species richness and assemblage composition showed similar variation among the taxonomic groups across environmental gradients and if a single taxon could be used as a predictor of diversity in the other groups .
species richness and composition in different taxa exhibited slightly different relationships to environmental gradients , leading to low degrees of concordance .
the diversity of mayflies and chironomids showed strongest relationships with stream acidity and water color , whereas stoneflies and caddisflies exhibited more complex correlations with geographical location and local environmental variables .
the overall assemblage composition , however , exhibited significant among-taxon congruence , as shown by mantel tests .
however , even these correlations remained rather low , thus limiting their potential for conservation purposes .
overall , our results do not support the use of single taxonomic groups as indicators of insect biodiversity in headwater stream ecosystems .
alternative approaches for lotic biodiversity assessment ( e.g. , morphospecies , higher-taxon richness , and environmental diversity ) should thus be examined in future studies .
the synthesis of resorcinarene derivatives with four or eight alkynyldiphenylphosphine or diphenyl phosphinite functional groups is reported .
the tetraphosphinite derivatives have effective c2v symmetry and have the potential to adopt two different boat conformations in which the arene groups with phosphinite substituents are horizontal or vertical .
a method for the determination of the solution-state conformation of the resorcinarene skeleton using correlated 1h and 13c nmr data is reported , and the boat conformation of one tetraphosphinite compound in the solid state has been determined crystallographically .
we examined the effects of body size ( 313 cm total length ) and temperature ( 4.5 , 8.0 , 12.0 , and 15.5 °c ) on routine ( rr ) and feeding ( rsda ) energy losses by laboratory-reared , young-of-year juvenile atlantic cod ( gadus morhua ) .
the magnitude of the effect of temperature on rr , expressed via the q10 , was nonlinear .
q10 values were greatest at temperatures between 4.5 and 8.0 °c and were lowest between 8.0 and 15.5 °c , with larger fish tending to exhibit the greatest change in rr irrespective of the temperature combination .
energy losses resulting from rsda were ~4 % of consumed energy , a value less than half that estimated for larger , year-1+ juvenile cod fed similar-sized rations .
data from this and other studies were combined to generate an equation estimating routine energy loss at different temperatures and body sizes for cod .
the equation describes rr over the eight orders of magnitude difference in body size from young larvae to adults within a range of environmental temperatures experienced by this species on georges bank and other areas in the north atlantic .
we conducted greenhouse defoliation experiments with clones of interior douglas-fir ( pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca ( beissn . )
franco ) over 3 years to assess the role of foliar nutrients as a resistance mechanism to western spruce budworm ( choristoneura occidentalis freeman ) defoliation .
the grafted clones were derived from mature trees ( i.e. , ortets ) that showed resistance or susceptibility to budworm defoliation in the forest .
current-year foliage was analyzed for concentrations of nitrogen (n) , sugars ( sucrose + fructose + glucose ) , phosphorus (p) , potassium (k) , magnesium ( mg ) , calcium ( ca ) , manganese ( mn ) , copper ( cu ) , iron ( fe ) , and zinc ( zn ) .
we computed rank correlations between foliar nutrient levels in the ortets and their corresponding clones to test the null hypothesis that foliar chemistry does not have a genetic basis ( h01 ) .
foliar concentrations of sugars and p were under genetic control to some degree , but concentrations of other nutrients were not .
we used analysis of variance to test the null hypotheses that foliar chemistry does not change in response to budworm defoliation ( h02 ) and that it is not different between resistant and susceptible clones ( h03 ) .
we rejected h02 for sugars , p , k , mn , and zn ; defoliation by the budworm changed levels of these nutrients and had divergent effects on concentrations of p , k , and zn in resistant clones .
we concluded that induced susceptibility , whereby defoliation alters foliar nutrients to make trees more favorable for insect feeding , appears to be an important determinant of douglas-fir resistance to the western spruce budworm .
failure to reject h03 implies that previously reported differences between the foliar nutrient levels in resistant douglas-firs and those in susceptible douglas-firs in the forest are probably caused by induced susceptibility .
for smooth potential barriers , we compare the quasi-classical tunneling time with an expression that gives a fully quantum mechanical tunneling time .
the expression we choose for the quantum mechanical tunneling time is one that has heuristic value .
we report results wherein this quantum mechanical tunneling time and the quasi-classical time differ significantly , both quantitatively and qualitatively .
to determine the reasons for these differences , we compare the trends in the two times that result from varying the potential .
